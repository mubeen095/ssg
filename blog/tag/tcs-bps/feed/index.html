<p>The <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/tcs-bps/" data-type="post" data-id="9001">TCS BPS </a>Interview questions that are commonly asked are listed here. Applicants can check out the TCS BPS Interview question for their interview preparation.</p>



<p><strong>1. What is inheritance?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong> Inheritance in object-oriented programming allows a new class (child class) to acquire properties and methods from an existing class (parent class), saving time by not having to rewrite everything from scratch. The Parent class, as the superclass, passes down its data members and behaviors to the child class.</p>



<p><strong>2. What are conditional statements?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans</strong>. Programmers often use conditional statements to control the flow of a program based on certain requirements or conditions. The program will execute specific instructions only if the stated condition is true. If the condition is not met, the program skips those instructions.</p>



<p>There are different types of conditional statements, such as if-else and if-then statements. Loops, which repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true, are also considered conditional statements. By using conditional statements, programmers can make their programs intelligent and responsive to different situations or inputs.</p>



<p><strong>3. What is RDBMS? What is the difference between RDBMS and DBMS?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong> RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) will organize and store data in a structured manner, using tables with rows and columns.</p>



<p>In an RDBMS, data is stored in tables, where each row represents a record, and each column represents a specific attribute or characteristic. These tables are connected through keys and define relationships between them. This allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.</p>



<p>DBMS (Database Management System) is a broader term, software that manages and controls access. It provides the interface for creating, modifying, and storing data in the database.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>RDBMS</strong></td><td><strong>DBMS</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Data Storage</td><td>Stores data in tables with rows and columns</td><td>Can store data in various formats, including files</td></tr><tr><td>Relational Model</td><td>Follows the relational model</td><td> may or may not follow the relational model</td></tr><tr><td>Data Integrity</td><td>Enforces referential integrity</td><td>May or may not enforce referential integrity</td></tr><tr><td>Normalization</td><td>Supports normalization</td><td>May support normalization</td></tr><tr><td>ACID Properties</td><td>Guarantees ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)</td><td>May or may not guarantee ACID properties</td></tr><tr><td>Scalability</td><td>Generally offers better scalability</td><td> limitations in scalability</td></tr><tr><td>Performance</td><td>Typically provides better performance</td><td>Performance can vary based on the implementation</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>4. What is the Software Development Life Cycle?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process, for software companies to design and build high-quality software products. The main goal of SDLC is to reduce project risks by careful planning so that the final software meets the customer&#8217;s requirements and expectations.</p>



<p>The SDLC process involves all the stages of creating a software product. It is broadly divided into six phases:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Requirements gathering: Understanding what the customer needs and wants from the software.</li>



<li>Design: Planning and outlining how the software will be built to meet those requirements.</li>



<li>Implementation: Writing the code and building the software based on the design.</li>



<li>Testing: Checking the software for errors and making it work as intended.</li>



<li>Deployment: Releasing the software for use by the customer or end-users.</li>



<li>Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and fixes for the software after deployment.</li>
</ol>



<p>By following the SDLC process, software developers can create reliable, high-quality products that satisfy customer&#8217;s needs.</p>



<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>What are the different loops in a programming language?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans. </strong>Loops are a way to repeat a group of commands multiple times in a program. There are three main types: for loop, while loop, and do-while loop. You need to know the exact number of times you want to repeat something, the loop is used. But if you want to repeat until a certain condition is met, you have a while or do-while loop.</p>



<p><strong>6. What are the different types of Inheritance?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong> Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class (child class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (parent class).</p>



<p>There are five main types of inheritance in Java and C++:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Single-level Inheritance: In this type, a child class inherits from a single-parent class.</li>



<li>Multi-level Inheritance: Here, a child class inherits from a parent class, a child of another class (grandparent class).</li>



<li>Multiple Inheritance: In this type, a child class inherits from more than one parent class.</li>



<li>Hybrid Inheritance: This consists of multiple inheritances and hierarchical inheritance (explained below).</li>



<li>Hierarchical Inheritance: In this type, multiple child classes inherit from a single-parent class.</li>
</ol>



<p>Inheritance allows code reusability by passing down properties and methods from parent to child classes, avoiding the need to rewrite the same code multiple times. It helps in creating more organized and maintainable code.</p>



<p><strong>7. &nbsp;What is socket programming? Also, explain the main benefits and drawbacks of using Java Sockets.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong> Socket programming for two applications running on different systems to communicate over a network. It establishes a connection between the applications using the IP address and TCP port system, allowing them to exchange information through wireless network connections.</p>



<p>Advantages of Java Sockets:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Platform-independent, allowing communication across different systems.</li>



<li>Simple and consistent environment, making them easy to use.</li>



<li>Highly scalable, suitable for large-scale applications.</li>



<li>Built-in security features, providing enhanced security.</li>
</ul>



<p>Drawbacks of Java Sockets:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>High latency due to the use of UDP protocol.</li>



<li>Easy to use, they can be difficult to implement at times.</li>



<li>Limited support for network protocols.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>8. What is round trip time in networking?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong> Round trip time (RTT) is the total time, data packet from the source to the destination and back to the source. It measures the latency or delay in a network connection. A lower RTT indicates better network performance and responsiveness.</p>



<p><strong>9. What are Logical Operators</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>Ans. </strong>Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate boolean values (true or false) in programming. The common logical operators are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>)</strong>: Returns true if both operands are true, otherwise returns false.</li>



<li><strong>OR (<code>||</code>)</strong>: Returns true if at least one of the operands is true, otherwise returns false.</li>



<li><strong>NOT (<code>!</code>)</strong>: Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand (true becomes false, and false becomes true).</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>10. What are Local Variable and Global Variable</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Local Variable</strong></td><td><strong>Global Variable</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Declaration</td><td>Declared within a function or block</td><td>Declared outside of any function or block</td></tr><tr><td>Scope</td><td>Limited to the function or block where it is defined</td><td>Available throughout the entire program</td></tr><tr><td>Accessibility<br></td><td>Can only be accessed within the function or block</td><td>Accessible from anywhere in the program</td></tr><tr><td>Lifetime</td><td>Exists only as long as the function or block is executing</td><td>Exists for the entire duration of the program execution</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>11. What are  DDL/DML/TCL Commands</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>DDL (Data Definition Language)</strong>: DDL commands will define, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. Examples include <code>CREATE</code>, <code>ALTER</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>TRUNCATE</code>.</li>



<li><strong>DML (Data Manipulation Language)</strong>: DML commands will insert, update, and delete data within database tables. Examples include <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and <code>SELECT</code>.</li>



<li><strong>TCL (Transaction Control Language)</strong>: TCL commands are used to manage transactions in a database, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Examples include <code>COMMIT</code>, <code>ROLLBACK</code>, and <code>SAVEPOINT</code>.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>12. What are the Virtual Function and Pure Virtual Function</strong>?</p>



<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Virtual Function</strong></td><td><strong>Pure Virtual Function</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Definition</td><td><br>A member function in class declared with the <code>virtual</code> keyword</td><td>A virtual function with no implementation in the base class</td></tr><tr><td>Syntax</td><td><code>virtual returnType functionName(parameters);</code></td><td><code>virtual returnType functionName(parameters) = 0;</code></td></tr><tr><td>Implementation<br></td><td>implement in the base class<br></td><td>Has no implementation in the base class</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamic Binding</td><td>Allows dynamic binding; can be overridden in derived classes</td><td>Allows dynamic binding; must be overridden in derived classes</td></tr><tr><td>Base Class Instantiation</td><td> class can be instantiated directly</td><td> class cannot be instantiated directly; considered abstract</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
