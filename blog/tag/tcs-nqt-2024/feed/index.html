<p>Graduates who want to appear for the TCS NQT Exam should start preparing for the TCS NQT  Exam 2024. So, this TCS NQT Preparation guide will allow you an idea about the relevant topics to cover before the NQT Exam.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-1-understand-the-structure-of-the-tcs-nqt-exam"><strong>Step 1</strong>&#8211; Understand the structure of the TCS NQT Exam </h3>



<p>Understand the structure of the TCS NQT exam thoroughly. Check the latest exam pattern detailing the sections, topics covered, number of questions, and time duration for each section.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-2-try-the-tcs-nqt-mocktest-by-skillvertex">Step 2: Try the TCS NQT Mocktest by Skillvertex</h3>



<p>Skillvertex has begun the <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/tcs-nqt-mock-test/">mock test series.</a> Interested candidates can practice the mock test to excel in the NQT Examination. This mock test will help them improve their skills and knowledge &#8211; numerical, verbal, and coding. This can also boost your confidence and approach the NQT Examination more strategically.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-3-make-a-study-plan">Step 3- Make a Study Plan </h3>



<p>With around 1 month before the exam, create a structured study plan. Identify your weak areas that need more practice. Allocate time accordingly, focusing more on topics where you can score better to increase your overall marks. A TCS NQT Preparation Strategy can be made for your reference.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-4-solve-previous-year-questions">Step 4 &#8211; Solve Previous Year Questions </h3>



<p>Solving previous year&#8217;s questions and mock tests as the final step of preparation for TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) recruitment is highly recommended. TCS often repeats questions from previous years&#8217; papers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-5-30-day-roadmap-for-tcs-nqt-preparation"> Step 5 -30-day roadmap for TCS NQT preparation</h3>

<p>Days 21-30: Take mock tests to simulate exam conditions. Analyze your performance and work on weak areas. Revise formulas and strategies for quick problem-solving.</p>



<p>Hence, by solving past year questions, you can familiarize yourself with the pattern, difficulty level, and types of questions TCS frequently asks. This practice helps you identify your strengths and weaknesses, allowing you to focus on areas that need improvement. Additionally, mock tests simulate the exam environment, helping you manage your time effectively and build confidence for the real test.</p>
