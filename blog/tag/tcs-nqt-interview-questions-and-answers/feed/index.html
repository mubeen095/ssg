<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>def rotate_array(arr, k):
    return arr&#91;k:] + arr&#91;:k]

array = &#91;1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 2
print("Original array:", array)
print("Array after rotation:", rotate_array(array, k))</code></pre>



<p><strong>11. What is the purpose of the &#8220;super&#8221; keyword in Java?<br></strong>Answer: The &#8220;super&#8221; keyword is used to call the constructor or methods of the parent class from a subclass. It is also used to access the parent class members if they have been overridden in the subclass.</p>



<p><strong>12. Write a program to rotate elements of an array to the left by a given number of positions.</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">def rotate_array(arr, k):<br>    return arr[k:] + arr[:k]<br><br>array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>k = 2<br>print("Original array:", array)<br>print("Array after rotation:", rotate_array(array, k))<br></pre>



<p><strong>13. What is the difference between the pre-increment (++i) and post-increment (i++) operators in Java?<br></strong>Answer: The pre-increment operator (++i) increments the variable&#8217;s value and then returns the incremented value, the post-increment operator (i++) returns the current value of the variable and then increments it.</p>



<p><strong>14. Write a program to sort elements of an array in ascending order using any sorting algorithm.</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr&#91;j] &gt; arr&#91;j + 1]:
                arr&#91;j], arr&#91;j + 1] = arr&#91;j + 1], arr&#91;j]

array = &#91;64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", array)
bubble_sort(array)
print("Sorted array:", array)</code></pre>



<p><strong>15. What is the difference between abstract and concrete classes in Java?<br></strong>Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that its subclasses must implement. A concrete class is a class that can be instantiated and contains implementation for all of its methods.</p>



<p><strong>16. What is the purpose of the &#8220;static&#8221; block in Java?<br></strong>Answer: A &#8220;static&#8221; block in Java code,  executed when the class, is loaded into memory by the JVM. It will be to initialize static variables or perform another one-time initialization task.</p>



<p><strong>17. What is the difference between the &#8220;String&#8221; and &#8220;StringBuilder&#8221; classes in Java?<br></strong>Answer: &#8220;String&#8221; class -Java is immutable, meaning its value cannot be changed once created. The &#8220;StringBuilder&#8221; class, is mutable and provides a more efficient way to modify and manipulate strings.</p>



<p><strong>18. What is the purpose of the &#8220;instance of&#8221; operator in Java?<br></strong>Answer: The &#8220;instance of&#8221; operator in Java is used to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class or an instance of a subclass of that class. It is commonly used for type-checking and casting objects.</p>



<p><strong>19. What is the purpose of the &#8220;package&#8221; in Java?<br></strong>Answer: The &#8220;package&#8221; in Java to organize and group related classes and interfaces into a namespace. It helps to prevent naming conflicts and provides a way to control access to classes and interfaces.</p>



<p><strong>20. What is the difference between a &#8220;HashSet&#8221; and a &#8220;LinkedHashSet&#8221; in Java?<br></strong>Answer: A &#8220;HashSet&#8221; is an unordered collection of unique elements, while a &#8220;LinkedHashSet&#8221; is an ordered collection of unique elements that maintains the insertion order of elements.</p>



<p><strong>21. What is the purpose of the &#8220;switch&#8221; statement in Java?<br></strong>Answer: The &#8220;switch&#8221; statement in Java is a control flow statement that evaluates an expression and executes the associated block of code based on the value of the expression. It provides a more concise and readable alternative to nested &#8220;if-else&#8221; statements.</p>



<p><strong>22. What is the purpose of the &#8220;try-with-resources&#8221; statement in Java?<br></strong>Answer: The &#8220;try-with-resources&#8221; statement in Java is used to automatically close resources (e.g., files, database connections, etc.) that implement the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface. It ensures that these resources are properly closed, even in the event of an exception, eliminating the need for explicit closing in a &#8220;finally&#8221; block.</p>



<p>23. <strong>What is the difference between  &#8220;fail-fast&#8221; and &#8220;fail-safe&#8221; iterators in Java? </strong>Answer: In Java, &#8220;fail-fast&#8221; iterators throw a&nbsp;ConcurrentModificationException&nbsp;if the collection is modified while iterating over it. This behavior is designed to prevent unexpected behaviors and maintain the integrity of the data.</p>



<p> On the other hand, &#8220;fail-safe&#8221; iterators create a copy of the collection and iterate over that copy, allowing modifications to the original collection without causing exceptions. However, the iterator may not reflect the changes made to the original collection. The&nbsp;<code>Iterator</code>&nbsp;interface in Java implements the &#8220;fail-fast&#8221; behavior, while the&nbsp;<code>ConcurrentHashMap.KeySetView</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ConcurrentHashMap.Values</code>&nbsp;classes provide &#8220;fail-safe&#8221; iterators.</p>



<p>These questions cover various topics, including operators, control flow statements, exception handling, strings, collections, and packages, providing a more diverse set of potential interview questions for the TCS NQT Exam.</p>
