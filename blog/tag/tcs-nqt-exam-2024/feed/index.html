<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tcs-nqt-coding-questions-programing-questions-structure">TCS NQT Coding Questions, Programing Questions Structure </h2>



<p>Candidates can refer to the TCS NQT  Programming and the TCS NQT Coding Questions Structure.  Remember that, this NQT Programming Question is an essential section for the TCS NQT exam. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Exam Details</strong></td><td><strong>Programming Logic Exam for TCS</strong> <strong>NQT </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Number of Questions</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Time Limit</td><td>15 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Sections</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Topics Covered</td><td>Difficulty</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Type of Test</td><td>Negative Marking</td></tr><tr><td>Non-adaptive</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Moreover, TCS has introduced a Programming Logic Questions and Test section to ensure that new employees who are joining TCS have good coding knowledge. This section will have 10 questions, and you will get 15 minutes to solve them. The difficulty level is high, candidates can practice sample questions from previous TCS test papers.</p>



<p>Important Points:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There is no negative marking for incorrect answers.</li>



<li>The TCS NQT (National Qualifiers Test) is adaptive this year.</li>



<li>You will not get any physical rough paper during the exam. Instead, a calculator and rough work area will be available on your computer screen. </li>
</ul>



<p>The TCS NQT Coding Questions are designed to evaluate a candidate&#8217;s programming abilities. These questions cover &#8211; basic programming concepts to advanced data structures and algorithms. The difficulty level ranges from easy to highly challenging. Proper preparation by practicing coding problems is crucial to performing well in this section.</p>



<p>Therefore, having a strong grasp of programming fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and the ability to write clean, efficient code are key requirements. With dedicated practice and a systematic approach, candidates can improve their coding skills and increase their chances of succeeding in the TCS NQT coding round. Ultimately, this section aims to identify candidates with the necessary coding prowess for various technology roles at TCS.</p>
