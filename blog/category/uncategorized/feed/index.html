<p>a. SORT BY</p>



<p>b. ORDER</p>



<p>c. ORDER BY</p>



<p>d. SORT</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Which SQL Keyword Is Used To Sort The Result-Set</h2>



<p>Answer. Option B) Order By is the Correct Answer</p>



<p>In SQL, the <code>ORDER BY</code> the keyword is used to sort the result set of a query. You can use it to specify one or more columns by which you want to sort the rows in the result set, and you can also specify the sort order, which can be ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the basic syntax of the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 &#91;ASC | DESC], column2 &#91;ASC | DESC], ...;</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><code>column1, column2, ...</code> specifies the columns you want to retrieve in the result set.</li>



<li><code>table_name</code> is the name of the table from which you&#8217;re selecting data.</li>



<li><code>ORDER BY</code> is followed by one or more column names by which you want to sort the result set. You can also specify the sort order as <code>ASC</code> (ascending) or <code>DESC</code> (descending).</li>
</ul>



<p>For example, if you want to retrieve records from a &#8220;employees&#8221; table and sort them by the &#8220;last_name&#8221; column in ascending order, you would use the following SQL query:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name ASC;</code></pre>



<p>This would return the rows sorted by the &#8220;last_name&#8221; column in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>What is the difference between informed and uninformed searches? Can you explain this with some examples?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Difference Between Informed And Uninformed Search</h2>



<p>Answer.</p>



<p>Informed and uninformed searches are two categories of algorithms used in computer science and artificial intelligence to find solutions to problems. The main difference between them lies in how they explore a search space and make decisions. Let&#8217;s explore these differences with examples:</p>



<p><strong>1. Informed Search (Heuristic Search):</strong></p>



<p>Informed search algorithms use additional information, often in the form of heuristics, to guide their search process. Heuristics are rules or estimates that provide information about how close a particular state is to the goal. These algorithms prioritize nodes that are more likely to lead to a solution based on this heuristic information.</p>



<p><strong>Example:</strong> A* Search Algorithm</p>



<p>Consider a maze-solving problem where you have a maze and need to find the shortest path from the start point to the exit. In this case, an informed search algorithm like A* search can be used. A* utilizes a heuristic function that estimates the distance from each state to the goal. It then considers the sum of the actual cost to reach a state and the heuristic estimate. A* prioritizes expanding states that have lower estimated costs. This helps it efficiently find the shortest path through the maze.</p>



<p><strong>2. Uninformed Search (Blind Search):</strong></p>



<p>Uninformed search algorithms do not use any additional knowledge or heuristics about the problem domain. They explore the search space without considering how close a particular state is to the goal. These algorithms often have a systematic approach to exploration.</p>



<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Breadth-First Search (BFS)</p>



<p>Breadth-First Search is an example of an uninformed search algorithm. It explores the search space level by level, starting from the initial state and expanding all successor states before moving deeper. In a maze-solving scenario, BFS explores all possible paths systematically, ensuring that it finds the shortest path because it expands nodes in increasing order of their distance from the start.</p>



<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Depth-First Search (DFS)</p>



<p>Depth-First Search, another uninformed search algorithm, explores as deeply as possible along one branch of the search tree before backtracking. In the maze example, DFS may not guarantee finding the shortest path because it can explore deeply along one path before exploring other options.</p>



<p>In summary, the choice between informed and uninformed search depends on the problem and the available domain knowledge. Informed search algorithms are more efficient when you have relevant information, while uninformed searches are more suitable for situations where you lack such information or need to ensure completeness.</p>

<p>When you want to come up with cool usernames, you don&#8217;t have to rack your brain for ideas. There&#8217;s a quick and easy way to do it. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re into things like adventure and food.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-choose-an-instagram-username">How to Choose an Instagram Username?</h2>



<p>Selecting the right Instagram username is important because it represents your online identity. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to help you choose the best Instagram username:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reflect on Your Interests and Identity:</strong> Consider your hobbies, interests, and personality traits. Your username should reflect who you are and what you&#8217;re passionate about.</li>



<li><strong>Keep it Simple:</strong> A username should be easy to remember and type. Avoid using complex spellings or special characters that might be confusing.</li>



<li><strong>Be Creative:</strong> Try to come up with something unique and creative. Combine words, use puns, or create a portmanteau.</li>



<li><strong>Relevance:</strong> If you&#8217;re using Instagram for a specific purpose (e.g., photography, fitness, cooking), make sure your username relates to that theme.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid Trends:</strong> While trendy words or phrases might seem appealing now, they might not age well. Choose something that will still make sense in the future.</li>



<li><strong>Check Availability:</strong> Before getting too attached to a username, make sure it&#8217;s available. Instagram usernames can&#8217;t have spaces, so you might need to use underscores or periods to separate words.</li>



<li><strong>Short and Memorable:</strong> Short usernames are easier to remember. Aim for something that&#8217;s concise and leaves an impression.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid Numbers:</strong> While some numbers might be part of your desired username, try to avoid using random numbers that don&#8217;t mean anything to you.</li>



<li><strong>Research Social Media Handles:</strong> Check if your desired username is available on other platforms as well. Consistency across social media can help with branding.</li>



<li><strong>Test Pronunciation:</strong> Imagine saying your username out loud. Is it easy to say and understand? Avoid complicated spellings that could confuse people when spoken.</li>



<li><strong>Think Long-Term:</strong> Choose a username that you won&#8217;t outgrow quickly. While something might be funny or relevant now, consider how it will hold up over time.</li>



<li><strong>Personalize:</strong> If you&#8217;re comfortable, consider incorporating your name or a variation of it into your username. This adds a personal touch.</li>



<li><strong>Ask for Opinions:</strong> Sometimes, a fresh perspective can help you see things you might have missed. Ask friends or family for their thoughts on your potential usernames.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid Overused Words:</strong> Stay away from common words like &#8220;official,&#8221; &#8220;real,&#8221; or generic terms like &#8220;foodie&#8221; if you want your username to stand out.</li>



<li><strong>Be Positive:</strong> Choose a username that radiates positivity and good vibes. This can attract more engagement and followers.</li>
</ol>



<p>Remember, your Instagram username is an extension of your online presence. Take your time to find something that feels right and aligns with your goals for your Instagram account.</p>

<p>Step into the world of technology and money, where blockchain is changing things. In 2024, there&#8217;s a big need for people who know how to work with blockchain in India. This means there are lots of good jobs and good pay. In this article, we&#8217;ll look at how much money these blockchain developers make in India and why. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll also see what skills they need and why they&#8217;re so important. As companies use blockchain to make things better and safer, they&#8217;re ready to pay these smart people well because they&#8217;re helping to make the way we do digital transactions and other things even better in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-blockchain-developer">What is the Blockchain Developer?</h2>



<p>At the heart of blockchain technology is the blockchain developer. This specialist has a vital role in making and enhancing the rules for how blockchain works. This means they create systems where data can be both kept in one place or spread out. They&#8217;re also the ones who make smart contracts. In easier words, a Core Blockchain Developer prepares the foundation that others can use to build things. They deal with online apps that rely on blockchain. To put it simply, a blockchain developer is someone who helps make blockchain technology better. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-types-of-blockchain-developers-and-their-roles">What are the types of Blockchain Developers and their Roles?<br></h2>



<p>In the realm of blockchain development, there exist two distinct categories of professionals:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Core Blockchain Developers</li>



<li>Blockchain Software Developers</li>
</ol>



<p>A Core Blockchain Developer assumes the role of a decision-maker at a higher level. This involves tasks like establishing the fundamental structure of a blockchain system. They delve into determining the blueprint for protocols, crafting consensus mechanisms, and making pivotal choices related to blockchain. Their expertise requires a deep understanding of the inner workings of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>On the flip side, a Blockchain Software Developer specializes in crafting decentralized applications that can operate within the framework set by Core Blockchain Developers. They leverage the architecture and protocols laid out by the latter to create applications functioning on blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the responsibility of a Blockchain Developer extends across the entire lifecycle of blockchain applications. This encompasses research, analysis, design, and implementation. They proficiently employ various programming languages to construct interfaces and systems tailored for diverse applications. This versatility spans domains like payment processing, supply chain management, and beyond.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-skills-for-blockchain-developer">What are the Skills For Blockchain Developer?</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Creating the Blueprint of Blockchain / Building Blockchain Architecture</strong>: A blockchain developer needs to start by understanding what blockchain is all about. They should know how it works and how it&#8217;s constructed. Later on, they&#8217;ll dive into things like fancy cryptographic codes and distributed ledgers. For instance, reading the original Bitcoin blockchain paper is a smart way to get the main idea. But it can be quite time-consuming, so often learning from blogs or online courses can be really helpful.</li>



<li><strong>Building Blocks of Information</strong>: Think of this as using special tools to arrange blocks in a certain order. Blockchain developers have to be good at using these tools when they&#8217;re needed. They&#8217;re always trying out different ways to arrange blocks of data, like using something called Merkle trees. This is kind of like arranging your toys in a neat way, but a lot more complex. They also use secret codes to keep things safe.</li>



<li><strong>Cryptography</strong>: Just like in a secret agent movie, where they use secret codes to talk securely, blockchain developers use special codes to keep information safe. There are many types of these codes, like SHA256 and KECCAK256. It&#8217;s like having a special lock for your secret treasure chest.</li>



<li><strong>Creating Smart Programs</strong>: Imagine if you could make your toys come alive and do cool stuff when certain things happen. That&#8217;s what a blockchain developer does with something called smart contracts. These are like mini-programs that can do things when certain conditions are met. They&#8217;re super handy for making sure things happen just the way they&#8217;re supposed to, without waiting or needing extra people.</li>



<li><strong>Making Online Stuff</strong>: Being a blockchain developer means building cool things online. It&#8217;s like creating games or apps that work with blockchain. This involves both making things look good on the outside (front-end) and making them work well on the inside (back-end).</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-key-roles-of-blockchain-developers">What are the Key Roles of Blockchain Developers?</h2>



<p>A blockchain developer is like a digital security superhero. They set up special locks to keep bad guys out of the company&#8217;s important information. They also help build the technology and teach others how to use it. They work with other tech people to plan and design everything from the start.</p>



<p>The main tasks of a core blockchain developer include creating the main structure of the blockchain and making sure it&#8217;s safe. Here are some other things they do:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Designing the way the blockchain looks and works.</li>



<li>Figuring out how to keep everything safe and sound.</li>



<li>Working together with other tech people to make sure everything is set up just right.</li>
</ul>



<p>So, whether it&#8217;s building the foundation of a super cool digital system or making sure all the locks and codes are just perfect, being a blockchain developer is like being a tech wizard in a world of secret codes and digital adventures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="eligibility-of-blockchain-developers">Eligibility Of Blockchain Developers </h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="directory-submission-sites-list">Directory Submission Sites List&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Directory Submission Sites : Welcome to the world of directory submission sites, where digital landscapes converge to connect businesses, services, and ideas with a global audience. In an era dominated by online presence, these directories serve as digital signposts, guiding users through a vast expanse of information. From promoting businesses to enhancing SEO, directory submission sites offer a versatile platform to showcase your endeavors. Join us as we delve into the significance, benefits, and strategies that make directory submissions indispensable in the modern digital marketing toolkit. Read this article to know more on the Directory Submission Sites List&nbsp;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-directory-submission-sites">What are Directory Submission Sites?</h2>



<p>Directory submission sites are online platforms that serve as repositories of categorized links, information, and resources from various industries and niches. They act as virtual directories or indexes, categorizing websites and their details based on their content, purpose, and relevance. These sites allow users to submit their website URLs, along with descriptions and relevant keywords, into specific categories or subcategories.</p>



<p>The main purpose of directory submission sites is to provide users with a curated list of websites, making it easier for them to find information, products, or services related to their interests. These directories can cover a wide range of topics, such as business, education, health, technology, travel, and more.</p>



<p>In addition to helping users discover relevant websites, directory submission sites also offer several benefits for businesses and website owners. These include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Increased Visibility:</strong> By submitting your website to relevant directories, you increase its online visibility and make it accessible to a broader audience.</li>



<li><strong>Improved SEO:</strong> Directory submissions can contribute to your website&#8217;s search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. Quality directory backlinks can positively influence your website&#8217;s search engine rankings.</li>



<li><strong>Targeted Traffic:</strong> Directories attract users looking for specific information. When your website is listed in a relevant category, you can attract targeted traffic that is more likely to convert.</li>



<li><strong>Credibility and Authority:</strong> Being listed in reputable directories can enhance your website&#8217;s credibility and authority within your industry or niche.</li>



<li><strong>Brand Exposure:</strong> Directory submissions provide an additional avenue for showcasing your brand and reaching potential customers.</li>

<li><strong>Networking Opportunities:</strong> Some directories also serve as platforms for networking and collaboration within specific industries.</li>
</ol>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while directory submissions can offer benefits, not all directories are created equal. Quality matters more than quantity. It&#8217;s recommended to focus on reputable and relevant directories that provide genuine value to users.</p>



<p>Remember that the significance of directory submission sites has evolved over time, and while they are still relevant, they should be just one part of a comprehensive digital marketing strategy that includes other tactics like content creation, social media engagement, and more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="different-types-of-directory-submission-sites">Different Types of Directory Submission Sites</h2>



<p>Directory submission sites can be categorized into different types based on various factors such as their purpose, structure, and the way they function. Here are some common types of directory submission sites:</p>

<li><strong>Niche Directories:</strong> These directories are focused on specific industries, topics, or niches. They cater to a targeted audience interested in a particular subject. Examples include directories for health, travel, technology, and more.</li>

<li><strong>E-commerce Directories:</strong> These directories focus on listing online stores and e-commerce websites. They are helpful for businesses that sell products online. Examples include Shopify&#8217;s E-commerce University and Best of the Web&#8217;s Shopping Directory.</li>



<li><strong>Business Directories:</strong> Business directories list various businesses, allowing users to find specific services or products. These directories are often used by people seeking particular types of services. Examples include Yellow Pages and Manta.</li>



<li><strong>Web Design and Development Directories:</strong> These directories cater to the web design and development industry, listing agencies, freelancers, and resources related to web design and development. Examples include Awwwards and Behance.</li>

<li><strong>Educational Directories:</strong> These directories focus on educational institutions, courses, and resources. They are valuable for students and professionals seeking educational opportunities. Examples include Coursera and edX.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="program-error-signals">Program Error Signals</h2>



<p>Signals in computers enable communication between processes and the operating system. They&#8217;re triggered when a program encounters a critical error, signaling the OS to notify the process. Some processes have signal handlers for essential tasks before leaving the CPU. While signals and interrupts share similarities, interrupts are processor-generated and kernel-handled, whereas signals are kernel-generated and process-handled. Error signals often result in program termination, creating a &#8220;core&#8221; file for debugging, revealing the process state at termination.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="error-signals">Error Signals</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SIGFPE:</strong> Indicates an arithmetic error such as division by zero or a floating-point error. Storing integer data in a location used for a floating-point operation triggers an &#8220;invalid operation&#8221; exception.</li>



<li><strong>SIGILL:</strong> Denotes an illegal instruction, generated when executing a garbage instruction or one that a program lacks privileges to execute. In C, encountering this signal is unlikely unless the object file is corrupted. It&#8217;s also generated in the event of a stack overflow.</li>



<li><strong>SIGSEGV (Segmentation Violation):</strong> Occurs when a process attempts to access a memory location not allocated to it, often caused by de-referencing a wild pointer. It&#8217;s triggered when a program exceeds its memory space, detected by the memory protection mechanism.</li>



<li><strong>SIGBUS (Bus Error):</strong> Named for &#8220;Bus error,&#8221; this signal is generated when invalid memory is accessed. Unlike SIGSEGV, where the memory location exists but is invalid, SIGBUS occurs when de-referencing a memory location outside the allocated memory space.</li>



<li> <strong>SIGABRT –</strong>&nbsp;If an error itself is detected by the program then this signal will  generated using call to abort(). This signal is even used by the standard library to report an internal error. assert() function in c++ also uses abort() to generate this signal.<br></li>
</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// Example of 'SIGABRT' error
 
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
 
    int arr&#91;5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   
    // SIGABRT error
    arr&#91;6] = 6;
   
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// Example of 'SIGABRT' error
 
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
 
    int arr&#91;5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   
    // SIGABRT error
    arr&#91;6] = 6;
   
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Abort signal from abort(3) (SIGABRT)
</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SIGSYS –</strong>&nbsp;<br>This signal will be sent to a process when there is an invalid argument is passed to a system call.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>SIGTRAP –</strong>&nbsp;<br>This signal will be sent to process when an exception has occurred. This will be  requested by the debugger to get informed. For example, if a variable changes its value then this will trigger it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div id="faq-question-1700656353759" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3.What are the various types of error in signal?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. At the time of transmission, errors were found in  the binary data sent from the sender to the receiver due to the noise during transmission. Those various types of error are <strong>Single-bit error, multiple-bit error, and burst error</strong> are the types of error.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-return-type-of-getchar-fgetc-and-getc">What Is The Return Type Of Getchar(), Fgetc() And Getc() ?</h2>



<p>In C, when you use <code>getchar()</code>, <code>fgetc()</code>, or <code>getc()</code>, what you get back is not a character but an integer. So, it&#8217;s a good idea to catch that integer by using an integer-type variable. These functions return the ASCII value of the character you input or read, and using an integer-type variable helps you handle and check for special cases like the end of the file.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>

char ch;  /* May cause problems */  
while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF)  
{ 
   putchar(ch); 
} </code></pre>



<p>This version uses integer to compare the value of getchar().</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>int in;   
while ((in = getchar()) != EOF)  
{ 
   putchar(in); 
} </code></pre>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is the return type of Getchar ()?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. The getchar() function obtains a character from stdin. It returns the character that was read in the form of an integer or EOF if an error occurs</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1700220336240" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. What is getc () and Getchar () in C?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. In C, there are two ways to read characters: <code>getc()</code> and <code>getchar()</code>. The key difference is that <code>getc()</code> can read from anywhere, not just the usual input. But, if you&#8217;re just grabbing a character from the regular input, using <code>getchar()</code> is like taking a quick and easy route – it&#8217;s the same as saying <code>getc(stdin)</code>. So, if you&#8217;re sticking to the standard input, <code>getchar()</code> is the simpler choice.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-1700220342321" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q3. What is the difference between fgetc and getc?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans.<br />In C, there are two buddies, <code>fgetc()</code> and <code>getc()</code>, doing the same job of getting characters. But here&#8217;s the thing: <code>fgetc()</code> is a real subroutine, not just a fancy term like &#8220;macro&#8221; used for <code>getc()</code>. However, there&#8217;s a trade-off – <code>fgetc()</code> might be a bit slower than <code>getc()</code>, but it&#8217;s more efficient in terms of using less disk space. So, depending on your needs, you might choose one over the other.</p>
