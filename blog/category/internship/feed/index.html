										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Top 6 Online Programs to Change the Game</h1>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to rolling the dice, 6 is the real 10.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As 2022 hits the pedal, we all are looking forward and making plans for the year—but sometimes to move ahead, you must look back. </span></p>
<h2><b> <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-206" src="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG-20230520-WA0007.jpg" alt="program" width="1300" height="1300" />How did 2022 lay the base for 2023?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it goes without saying that 2022 was a year of transformation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though 2021 was about survival, 2022 was the year when people, corporations, and society started looking ahead to influence their futures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year resulted in a K-type recovery with companies that had invested in technology, digital, and data. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note</span></i><b><i>&#8211; </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A K-shaped recovery is an economic recovery following a recession where only certain sectors, industries, or areas of the economy recover while others persistently lag.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is difficult to make accurate predictions in an unpredictable environment, it is without a doubt that the year ahead will bring in several golden opportunities. </span></p>
<p><b><i>And, we want you to have all the arrows in your quiver!</i></b></p>
<h3><b>What are the top 6 online upskilling programs to start with?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more businesses in India embrace digital ways of working, career opportunities in high-growth fields are on the rise, and employers are seeking to bridge the gap for trained talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your time to shine! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the following areas in the world of technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a side note, although these fields can be pursued individually, I suggest you, at least, check out the beginner courses for all of the following to build a strong and versatile foundation.</span></p>
<p><b><i>After all, a jack of all trades is better than a master of one.</i></b></p>
<h3><b>1- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</b></h3>
<p><b><i>Did you know that Eugene Goostman, a chatbot, managed to pass the Turing Test?</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan Turin created the test in 1950 to evaluate a machine’s intelligence. If the machine could convince a human that they were actually talking to another human, the machine would pass the test. </span><b><i>Eugen managed to achieve this in 2014, making 1 out of 3 judges think that it was human.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No! For the last time, machines are not going to take over humans. The fact above just goes to show the ever-lasting potential of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders predict that Ethical AI frameworks will play a significant role in 2022. Considering how Big Tech has been held accountable for its biased AI algorithms, we will see an increased focus on the responsible and ethical development of AI/ML. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with ML decision-making processes, several ethical tests will also be extended to data privacy. Companies will start standardizing their processes accordingly, and we will see a stark change in the organization’s data strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, India will need more ML/AI experts and you can be one of them.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Check out the Skillvertex Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Upskilling programs and let us help you transform your curiosity into expertise.</i></b></p>
<h3><b>2- CyberSecurity</b></h3>
<p><b><i>What do you call a rehabilitation meeting for alcoholic hackers? Anonymous Anonymous.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above is a joke (lame? probably). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the threat of breaches and leaks in information frameworks is extremely real. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, there is a significant increase in the number of cyberattacks targeting software supply chains. These attacks are particularly effective because they can take down an organization&#8217;s entire software supply chain and services, resulting in massive business disruptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, we can expect these attacks to become even more common in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybercriminals will realize that these supply chain attacks are an effective way to cause maximum disruption, and once inside the trusted gates, the hardest part of the hack job is already done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber Security professionals are responsible for preventing such attacks and protecting the company. There are more than 3,000 jobs available for professionals in Cyber Security in top MNCs.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Join the Skillvertex Cyber Security Upskilling Program and put your chit in the hat. This just might be the lottery you are destined to win.</i></b></p>
<h3><b>3- Data Science</b></h3>
<p><b><i>Without data science, companies would be blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like a clueless deer on a freeway.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science, an interdisciplinary field, is a mixture of multiple Machine Learning algorithms, tools, and techniques that aim to extract trends and patterns from raw and unstructured business data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not a new concept for businesses any more. It has become an integral cog in the wheel of business, especially for enterprises that rely on data to gather insights. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know Netflix was able to influence 80% of its content just by analyzing data from its 100+ million subscribers?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science professionals have an expert understanding of several mathematical and statistical techniques using which they draw conclusions to the problems and help in the growth and development of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 18,000 Data Science jobs available for both entry-level and experienced professionals in India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust me. It does not get better than this.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Check out the Skillvertex Data Science Upskilling Program and answer your calling.</i></b></p>
<h3><b>4- Full Stack Web Development</b></h3>
<p><b><i>Every coin has two sides- heads or tails. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>If you cannot choose, just grab the coin.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. I am not asking you to steal. I am just asking you to get the best of both worlds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development is divided into two parts- the aesthetics of the front end and the technology of the back end. However, to become the master of both, you would have to become a full-stack developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack web development is one of the most demanded and versatile fields. As a full-stack developer, you would be able to handle servers, databases, as well as clients. There are different kinds of stacks that one needs to use based on the project’s requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, India has over 19,000 jobs available for Web Developers in top MNCs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for full-stack developers will steadily increase in the market as new technologies enter. While it comes with its bells and whistles, you will have to learn a lot of stuff that other developers do not have to, and it can seem a little daunting to someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry!</span></p>
<p><b><i>Dot the i’s and cross the t’s with the Skillvertex Full Stack Web Development Upskilling Program where not only you will learn the skills you need, but also get the right career guidance.</i></b></p>
<h3><b>5- Digital Marketing</b></h3>
<p><b><i>They say the best place to hide evidence is Page 2 of Google Search.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you are a company in search of an online presence, you would want to be on the first page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing is the best way of marketing and advertising numerous products and services of various companies. With the help of the plethora of digital platforms available, such as websites, mobile applications, email, social media, search engine rankings, and more, Digital Marketers can advertise whatever their companies offer. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-digital-marketing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a broad field that includes Email Marketing, Content Writing, Social Media Marketing (SMM), Search Engine Optimization (SEO), etc. However, the main responsibility of a Digital Marketer, irrespective of the department they work in, is to create broad awareness of their brand and generate leads through free and paid digital channels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more and more organizations shifting to make an online presence and expand their clientele, the demand for Digital Marketing has reached new heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 14,000 jobs available for Digital Marketing professionals specializing in the numerous sectors of this domain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, this seems like a good place for you to start.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Join the Skillvertex Digital Marketing Upskilling Program and take that first step towards a glowing career.</i></b></p>
<h3><b>6- Finance</b></h3>
<p><b><i>Money is a terrible master but an excellent servant.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have seen trends come and go; the only thing that remains constant is money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find finance intimidating- welcome to my world. All of us think that finance is all about mavericks dressed in black panicking over frantic stock tickers. However, from what I have researched, finance has a seat at every table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not matter if you work in tech or education, consulting or advertising. Your company needs cash flow to pay salaries, distribute dividends, and reinvest in product innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finance is at the core of business decision-making. If you’re pitching a project or angling for additional funding, understanding and being able to communicate how you can turn that investment into revenue for your organization will help you make a more convincing argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re entering the workforce as a young professional without extensive experience, showing you have business knowledge makes you a more attractive candidate. This is particularly relevant in </span><a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/learning-about-finance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-finance fields</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where financial education is less common but no less fundamental to running a successful business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of finance has grown beyond traditional big banks. The need is everywhere. Learning how to take quantitative data and use it to solve problems and make sound business decisions is a valuable skill that can serve you in your career now and in the future.</span></p>
<p><b><i>So, join the <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/finance/">Skillvertex Finance</a> Upskilling Program and become a real-world problem solver.</i></b></p>

<p>Choosing the right career path after college is definitely one of the most important decisions one takes in their lifetime. This is a decision crucial for understanding the placement of the rest of your life. That’s why it’s absolutely necessary to choose careers in which your interest lies and one which is profitable as well.</p>

<p>However, since the decision is so important for the rest of your life. Some might even find it very difficult to find careers they&#8217;re interested in. Because, such decisions come with a lot of pressure, not just pressure we put on ourselves, but even the pressure that’s put on us by people in our surroundings, such as parents, relatives, friends, teachers, etc.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-do-after-college-in-india-2024">What to Do After College in India 2024</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-segregate-a-group-of-interests-you-have"><strong>1. Segregate a Group of Interests You Have</strong></h3>



<p>To choose the perfect career, we should first list out many subjects/career paths that interest you and then segregate the paths.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-the-scope-it-has-in-the-future"><strong>2. The Scope it Has in the Future</strong></h3>



<p>It is very important to be mindful while choosing a future and know what importance it holds shortly. As that technology impacts the job opportunities provided by the stream.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-the-pay"><strong>3. The Pay</strong></h3>



<p>Knowing the average payment received by people in a particular stream, helps us classify whether or not to choose the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-the-skills-required"><strong>4. The Skills Required</strong></h3>



<p>When we’re choosing a path it is also very important to know the skills, and tasks that you are expected to learn to land a good job.<br>for example, in the hotel management industry employees are expected to know how to communicate efficiently with their co-workers as well as clients, and are also expected to know how to serve those are vital skills, on the other hand, a software engineer is expected to know coding, computer-related skills, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-review"><strong>5. Review</strong></h3>



<p>A few other very important things to consider before choosing a future to review with other presently working professionals and career counselors are very important when we’re stuck on what to choose.<br>They usually provide us with information on each work-life and discuss various other factors. They give us a clear view of what we should pursue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-pros-and-cons-list"><strong>6. Pros and Cons List</strong></h3>



<p>Another very helpful method in the choosing process, making a pros and cons list will broaden the advantages and disadvantages of each work.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-proper-research"><strong>7. Proper Research</strong></h3>



<p>Research while choosing a future is a must. Not only should we listen to facts and advice stated by others, but we must also research for ourselves to be fully sure of what we’re going to be working on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-make-sure-it-is-your-decision"><strong>8. Make Sure It is Your Decision</strong></h3>



<p>This is the most important point. Usually, children get into professions advised or forced by their parents or near ones and this usually leads to hatred of the job or dissatisfaction.</p>



<p>Choosing a career path can be considered the most important decision we make in our life. Thus, we should make sure we make this decision with utmost clarity.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are Data structures, Data structure algorithms, and their types?</strong></h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="730" height="480" src="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/types.png" alt="" class="wp-image-294"/></figure>



<p>Algorithms and data structures are the foundation of effective programming. They serve as the foundation of every software system, allowing programmers to manipulate data in a systematic and effective way. Understanding and using data structures and algorithms is essential for developing reliable and scalable applications in the Java programming language.</p>



<p>Effective data management, storage, and retrieval are made possible by data structures. Every type of data structure, from straightforward arrays and linked lists to more intricate ones like trees, graphs, and hash tables, has its own special qualities and benefits. Developers may optimize operations like searching, sorting, insertion, and deletion by choosing the right data structure, which improves performance and reduces time complexity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/sv-lab/">Data Structures?</a></strong></h2>



<p>Data structures serve as a means of organizing and storing data. It is a method of setting up data on a computer to make it easily accessible and up-to-date.</p>



<p>The best data format for your project should be chosen based on your requirements and project. For instance, you can use the Array data structure if you want to keep data in memory in a sequential manner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of Data Structure</strong></h2>



<p>Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Linear data structure</li>



<li>Non-linear data structure</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Linear data structures</strong></h2>



<p>The elements are placed sequentially, one after the other, in linear data structures. The elements are simple to use because they are set up in a specific order.</p>



<p>However, because of operational difficulties, linear data structures might not be the ideal option when program complexity rises.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Array Data Structure</strong></h3>



<p>The elements in memory are organized in a continuous memory array. An array&#8217;s items are all of the same type. Additionally, the programming language affects the kinds of elements that can be stored as arrays.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1yWgXpjGDPUTvZcQbmIkX8fY2o4lnwR3WFEKshCUPmVSTInIU8pYi3iAMn6nN3kOEtOQO5zS_hqhtJQ_Tl0bHsbqbN3oW1_zu8JRFpcl4D4ZeHFt_SsLBYagziYiY7SZPsrfDtOe4ZwGzOUATJgncrM" alt="" style="width:353px;height:232px"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Stack Data Structure</strong></h3>



<p>The LIFO technique is used to store elements in stack data structures. In other words, the last element in a stack will be taken out first. It operates similarly to a stack of plates, where the final plate left on the pile is taken out first.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cEkdqNPIlQfgiiRr2ZszlIX5YSp4L51n5WRJz3QPZ3n9b9fB_f7LYTbcnIQmH4v3KlLCznqgV_5iWe9pAPJ_VWeFbGKccX4hmf-vd8_KB2MS12rRMx7g7wzMuOfhZlsNtSD-iUDui0M_xOn-_5kMzvY" alt="" style="width:367px;height:215px"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Queue Data Structure</strong></h3>



<p>Unlike stacks, the queue data structure works on the FIFO principle, where the first element stored in the queue will be removed first.</p>



<p>It works just like a queue of people at the ticket counter, where the first person in the queue will get the ticket first.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FLsKW0D2RVyKjknMvRxv9J1WWRga-Sm0w0SEw6hHq6s7JmhvmEoQyDpc8sN58i2M825Vk-43msoOdvlFKd9GbMQ8UnDzjrhyJUijWfY95V1n4QyVmUgiqn8xJiHXive1vuKg0OOuSifka71x2-2uQeE" alt="" style="width:430px;height:215px"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Linked List Data Structure</strong></h3>



<p>Data components in a linked list data structure are linked together by a number of nodes. Additionally, each node has an address for the node behind it as well as data elements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SQ6R0T8RvvZoKHCai-fTqpRTJrXbxngOJVhpji7mJvOniWHOz3mciaACCCnPucwMIu3Xat8dymuJmudzep9LGNwH7IcmiHdi5fhlI0W1IbZy4mt7tabnW18vuU-hs082uXaBp15PJQ7SpOUOV8220O8" alt="" style="width:597px;height:93px"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Non-linear data structures</strong></h2>



<p>Non-linear data structures differ from linear data structures in that their elements are not in any particular order. Instead, they are arranged hierarchically, with each piece related to another on some level.</p>



<p>Graph- and tree-based data structures are subsets of non-linear data structures.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Graph Data Structure</strong></h3>



<p>Each node is referred to as a vertex in a graph data structure, and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BZTG3gQFrzOcSOQypPRi59ueqO3QFhuzyf7jbbnMcT7mORlL1nXjr6mvyd6w5JBWKKNv80HZHfcij6D_JUVmHfmBpm57ekyvrDhiOS7Tc1Zxo1BQmsG8klVWEjJVnlaRt0Y5oKDUXNKNkqSFGS5FTc0" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Trees Data Structure</strong></h3>



<p>A tree is a collection of vertices and edges, much like a graph. However, there can only be one edge between any two vertices in a tree data structure.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yqihvEpshLtsbs2-_f7imnpazP3IAWahBmvs_vy37TQjZBID5GVO_UKsFokPJuoXD1TcJsx8cbZoRhqZxdwaZsXwXLngBmgYDllhMC3RFMbhhwAb-e8PGI7e1NX8BqSqcVv3792_wGA5F0wj4qekSw4" alt="" style="width:531px;height:300px"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are algorithms?</strong></h2>



<p>An algorithm is a process with well-defined steps for solving a specific problem. Or, to put it another way, an algorithm is a limited set of rules or instructions that are used to carry out a certain task that has been predetermined. A flowchart or pseudocode can be used to illustrate the answer (logic), which is all that is needed to solve a problem and not the entire program or code.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Sorting Algorithms</strong></h3>



<p>Sorting algorithms are detailed processes for moving data around in lists and arrays. An array may need to be sorted, for instance, in numerical or lexical order. Searching algorithms, for example, are made more effective by sorting algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Evpzc5-CAfURz2dMY0CY7-LPYltReMUMDdQxDkIQ9gsEVHoP-WamQOQ12gmEGplLPLYdQV5I40dHO1j5w9oOD_qIxla0iW5bGvjTJ2Otg3-Ujf9e-bt_NmgehuhDw9_6Kj0xDMgxzBiid_aKDOzh3bU" alt="" style="width:380px;height:437px"/></figure>



<p>Three basic sorting algorithms are insertion sort, merge sort, and rapid sort.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Insertion Sort</strong></h4>



<p>Insertion sorting is a useful method for completing the task of sorting tiny data sets that are almost sorted. An array is split into sorted and unsorted portions using this procedure. Once all of the items are sorted, it picks one from the unsorted section and moves it to the sorted part.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Merge Sort</strong></h4>



<p>Linked lists are best organized using a merge sort. A list is split in half until it can no longer be divided. After that, it compares and combines the pieces in the same way they were split apart.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>QuickSort</strong></h4>



<p>Quicksort is beneficial for large data sets. It divides an array into two subarrays based on the pivot, a designated data element. Elements in the first subarray have values lower than the pivot. Elements in the second subarray have values higher than the pivot. The algorithm locates the pivot in each subarray until there is just one element in each subarray.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Searching Algorithms</strong></h3>



<p>Specific elements within data structures are located and retrieved using search methods. Binary search and linear search are two prime examples.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ZRfBfkgXn614BtzTidQiTa9U1afv5lIIg8Q6_0ctl3V641T9EhDo5DtpP7zD5DXMAqLB8tbjs9LhxguRajgoZEgVCyx0qehhHHHHvCOz1v3aKGT2D-LVb4jPFn1zajrEyRpuTyFn7IBOxRLgQzbtzuc" alt=""/></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Linear Search</strong></h4>



<p>A sequential searching strategy for both sorted and unsorted data types is linear search. It moves through lists and arrays one element at a time, sequentially.</p>



<p>Consider a list of unsorted entries with the values &#8220;1&#8221; through &#8220;25.&#8221; The values would be explored in the order they are stored in a linear search for the value &#8220;5&#8221;.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Binary Search</a></strong></h4>



<p>An interval searching algorithm is binary search. Divided into many intervals, interval searches only travel over the desired interval. Because they divide the search space, they are more effective than sequential searches.</p>



<p>A sorted list can be efficiently searched for elements using binary search. It then moves across the anticipated interval after comparing the search value to the data structure&#8217;s middle element. Think about a sorted list of elements that ranges from &#8220;1&#8221; to &#8220;25.&#8221; If you were to perform a binary search for the value &#8220;5&#8221;, it would be compared to the middle element, &#8220;13.&#8221; Since &#8220;5&#8221; is smaller than &#8220;13,&#8221; the algorithm would look for the value in the lower half of the interval.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Graph Traversal Algorithms</strong></h3>



<p>In order to search nodes in graphs and trees, computer scientists employ graph traversal techniques. In contrast to linear data structures used in computer science, graphs require many searches in order to locate and retrieve data.</p>



<p>The breadth-first search and the depth-first search are two graph traversal techniques. They aid computer experts in resolving the most prevalent graph and tree-related issues.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R9MZY7tYoJX7NXkJOXdgkYLauO6-EY5vfsh9bXbvu5rn4ktpGrus9K9kMeiJw2SnV8Zy5wF_8l6Q-SM9FFla2X3oky0rRhS46yOrSP0ZI4c0bbgnFt8GihvLNzTjlvbvSRhV8rVmO9KVjEpIX6mvhMA" alt="" style="width:638px;height:225px"/></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breadth-First Search</strong></h4>



<p>The shortest route between two nodes is traversed using breadth-first search (BFS). It investigates nodes in decreasing order of distance, starting at the tree&#8217;s base.</p>



<p>BFS would go from left to right in the following order when searching nodes in a tree with two tiers of nodes:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tree root</li>



<li>Nodes in the first level</li>



<li>Nodes in the second level</li>
</ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Depth-First Search</strong></h4>



<p>From top to bottom, depth-first search (DFS) scans graphs. It travels as far as it can down one branch before turning around and moving on to the next.</p>



<p>Three methods exist for implementing DFS:</p>



<p>Starting from the tree&#8217;s root, the preorder traversal first travels through the left subtree before moving on to the right subtree.</p>



<p>In-order Starting at the left subtree, the traversal proceeds to the tree root, then to the right subtree.</p>



<p>Post-order Traversal: The tree root is reached after traversing the left subtree and the right subtree first.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Dynamic Programming Algorithms</strong></h3>



<p>Algorithms for dynamic programming are the next on the list of several sorts of algorithms. Dynamic programming is a technique for both computer programming and mathematical optimization. The approach was created by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found use in a wide range of disciplines, including economics and aerospace engineering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vGiM0MUe9jbNMEsAdHF-HadAlS2rrNtkkIvRo6di6ZlOSBM03pNWyi9YHatvc3K0RjV4_Nk9biCEtqHPD9hwP2FW1F0IC-sgvTDdsy1gtEsbu4xOazACpfyERGhLJwwFK-3FNULhrzHefo4LYKmGoBk" alt="" style="width:346px;height:346px"/></figure>



<p>It refers to the process of recursively decomposing a complex problem into smaller, simpler problems in order to make it simpler. Even though some decision problems can&#8217;t be broken down in this way, recursive breakdowns of decisions that span several points in time is common. Similar to this, an issue is considered to have an optimal solution in computer science if it can be solved by first decomposing it into smaller problems and then recursively finding the best answers to those smaller problems.</p>



<p>The following computer problems can be solved using a dynamic programming approach −</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fibonacci number series</li>



<li>Knapsack problem</li>



<li>Tower of Hanoi</li>



<li>All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall</li>



<li>Shortest path by Dijkstra</li>



<li>Project scheduling</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Greedy Algorithms</strong></h3>



<p>Any algorithm that makes the locally optimal decision at each stage when addressing a problem is said to be greedy. In many cases, a greedy method does not always result in the best answer; rather, a greedy heuristic may create locally optimal solutions that, in a reasonable length of time, approach a globally optimal solution.</p>



<p>For instance, the following heuristic is a greedy solution to the traveling salesman problem, which has a high computing complexity: &#8220;At each step of the journey, visit the nearest unvisited city.&#8221; This heuristic terminates in a fair number of steps, but it does not aim to discover the best solution; ordinarily, an optimal solution to a problem of this complexity necessitates an unreasonable number of steps. In mathematical optimization, greedy algorithms give constant-factor approximations to problems with submodular structures and solve combinatorial problems with matroid-like qualities in the best possible way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/z72-VXjTxr4zmd1UUug8dB5dxCM3B4aY8ltWgBQFByTsPVQNX1Arxrq3IeWN51gEPnzcDk5bEvn-L3G_m7k2ldJIVMEC7Odqr8qA97SkQtFC3arXRTA6uzG3-3uvFMeD9uVhTXbcQ0bJX4Tu2MEOr5s" alt="" style="width:517px;height:328px"/></figure>



<p>Most networking algorithms use a greedy approach. Here is a list of a few of them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Traveling Salesman Problem</li>



<li>Prim’s Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm</li>



<li>Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm</li>



<li>Dijkstra’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm</li>



<li>Graph: Map Coloring</li>



<li>Graph: Vertex Cover</li>
</ul>



<p>In conclusion, <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/">data structures and algorithms </a>are key ideas in computer science that make it possible to organize, manipulate, and solve problems with data effectively. From simple arrays to intricate structures like trees and graphs, data structures offer a methodical means of storing and accessing data. Algorithms, on the other hand, are detailed instructions or processes created to address particular computational issues by utilizing the strengths of data structures. They cover a wide range of algorithms, each with a specific function, such as searching, sorting, graph traversal, and dynamic programming. Programmers may efficiently and elegantly solve complicated problems by optimizing their code, using various data structures and techniques, and enhancing performance. For the purpose of creating scalable and reliable software solutions, mastery of these ideas is essential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/construction-planning/">Construction Planning</a>&#8211; 5-step Stairway to the Skies: Unlocking Success in Construction Projects</h1>
<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116" src="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Artboard-1.jpg" alt="Construction planning " width="2560" height="1203" />Imagine a world without the seven wonders. Can you remember the names of their architects?</span></i></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction planning oversees envisioning a fully constructed building and working backward to determine how to build it. Construction planning is defined as listing out all the required steps to build a structure by splitting them into defined activities, ordering these steps logically, and determining the necessary materials, manpower, and equipment that is required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have good construction planning to increase the likelihood of a successful construction project. Construction planning is critical for complex projects — everything from new houses to giant shopping malls. Don’t worry! We’ll cover all the important aspects of construction planning, along with software required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction planning and management includes several components such as:</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Scheduling</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to planning when to start, perform, and finish each task.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Organizing</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is getting all the moving pieces in a position to execute every task at hand. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Staffing</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is assigning duties and responsibilities to people on the project.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Directing</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the process of making sure that every task is happening as planned. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Monitoring</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is done to meet the requirements and performance benchmarks set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these requirements аre nоt fulfilled, а соnsiderаble time is devоted tо the соntrоlling stаge where the budget is mаnаged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, builders have several advanced tools, techniques, and equipment, but planning still remains an integral part of the construction management process. While construction planning is time-consuming, the benefits greatly outweigh the costs. A </span><a href="https://www.construction-institute.org/resources/knowledgebase/10-10-metrics/quality/topics/rt-039/pubs/sd-105" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1994 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Construction Industry Institute (CII) noted that there is a significant positive relationship between effort spent during the pre-project planning phase and the overall success of a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tо beсоme аn effeсtive соnstruсtiоn рlаnning exрert, yоu shоuld lооk аt соnstruсtiоn рlаnning with lоgiс, thоrоughness, аnd truthfulness. You will require expertise in construction methods and contracting. Planners must visualize the tasks to understand the relationships among them so that they can be carried out in an effective sequence.</span></p>
<h1><b>5 Phases of Construction Planning-</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a Construction Planning internship, we need to learn the 5 phases of Construction Planning. Additionally, we will also iterate the tools that you need to get a construction planning internship. </span></p>
<h2><b>Step 1: Create the project</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as you get a construction planning internship, you will be assigned a project. Create a Project Initiation Document that spells out the people, resources, and budget for the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every construction project, no matter how big or small, needs to start with a business case that lays out the feasibility of the project and what it is going to take to get the job done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stаrt by сreаting а Рrоjeсt Initiаtiоn Dосument (РID), which desсribes the fоllоwing in general:</span></p>
<p><b><i>People:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Number of workers needed which includes subcontractors, such as plumbers and electricians.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Resources</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Requisite materials for the design and construction plans.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Budget:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Total estimate of the cost of the project which is inclusive of manual labor, building materials, construction equipment, fees, and necessary permits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of this document is to outline the resources you will need to complete the project, both for your stakeholders and crew. </span></p>
<h3><b><i>Construction planning software features that can help with this:</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most options in Software Advice’s </span><a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/construction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction software directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer basic project management tools that help you to build a </span><a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/project-management-101/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working breakdown structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with all the tasks and activities listed out in the plan. The software can create the Gantt chart and manage the critical path of tasks for you.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Step 2: Draft an initial plan</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second step of your construction planning internship is to use the S.M.A.R.T. and C.L.E.A.R. processes to set concrete, specific goals for your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now comes the point where you need to turn your PID into a more concrete plan by setting S.M.A.R.T. and C.L.E.A.R goals. You will combine the specific resources that were enlisted in the previous step and use that to formulate a broader strategy that will guide how to start and execute the project.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Let’s begin with the definitiоn оf S.M.А.R.T. gоаls:</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Specific:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Set specific goals for your project such as deadlines for key milestones.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Meаsurаble</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Аgree оn hоw yоu will meаsure suссess fоr gоаls. Fоr exаmрle, is it gооd enоugh thаt yоu hаve stаrted lаying соnсrete by the deаdline yоu set, оr shоuld it be соmрletely set by thаt dаte?</span></p>
<p><b><i>Аttаinаble: </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yоu need tо hаve а рlаn in рlасe fоr hоw yоu’re gоing tо асhieve these gоаls. Fоr exаmрle, dоes yоur рrоjeсt deрend оn а sрeсifiс mаteriаl thаt might nоt be аvаilаble аt the quаntity yоu need when yоu need it? If sо, yоu need tо mаke аdjustments.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Reаlistiс: </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your gоаls need tо be within yоur аbilities аs а соnstruсtiоn mаnаger. Fоr exаmрle, if yоur рrоjeсt inсludes рlаns tо get the eleсtriсаl wоrk dоne within three mоnths when yоu’ve never dоne it in less thаn six mоnths fоr а рrоjeсt оf this size, yоu’re setting yоurself uр fоr fаilure.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Timely:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lаy оut а sрeсifiс time frаme in whiсh yоu саn reаlistiсаlly exрeсt thаt yоu саn асhieve these gоаls.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Nоw, let’s tаke а  lооk аt  С.L.E.А.R.  gоаls-  а  slight vаriаtiоn оn this strаtegy.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Соllаbоrаtive:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get everyоne оn bоаrd. Hоld а meeting befоre the рrоjeсt begins with the entire teаm tо lаy оut whаt is exрeсted аnd hаve them helр yоu identify аny роssible оbstасles.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Limited: </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit these gоаls bоth in terms оf sсорe аnd time frаme tо nоt gets оverwhelmed.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Emоtiоnаl:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ensure thаt yоur gоаls will get yоur emрlоyees fired uр аnd оn bоаrd.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Appreciable: </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Break up big goals into achievable tasks so you don’t overwhelm your workers.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Refinable:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Count on having to be flexible, because you can never predict what will happen on a job site.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>Construction planning software features that can help with this:</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, you want construction software with a good project management focus, but in this case, you need to get much more detailed with budgets and timelines, so you need software that has project management as well as accounting, materials tracking, </span><a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/construction/subcontractor-software-comparison/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contractor management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and document management.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Step 3: Execute the plan</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here comes the most important part of your construction planning internship. Call a meeting with your team, get on the same page, set expectations, and assign project managers to oversee progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time tо exeсute yоur рlаn. Stаrt by саlling а teаm meeting tо gо оver the рrоjeсt рlаn аnd соnstruсtiоn sсhedule. This meeting is сritiсаl fоr yоur рlаn’s suссess. Withоut buy-in frоm yоur сrew, yоu will fаil tо асhieve yоur оbjeсtives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tаlk with eасh рersоn оn yоur сrew individuаlly, if роssible, tо disсuss exрeсtаtiоns аnd give them аn орроrtunity tо аsk questiоns аbоut аnything they’re соnfused аbоut. Is yоur bасkhоe орerаtоr suрроsed tо be in dаily соmmuniсаtiоn with yоur engineering teаm beсаuse they’ll be wоrking in the sаme аreа аt similаr times? They need tо knоw thаt аs well аs whаt the exрeсtаtiоns аre in regаrds tо hоw they will соmmuniсаte аnd when.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yоu might аlsо need tо аssign а рrоjeсt mаnаger(s) tо оversee yоur teаms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a very small business, you may be the only project manager, but you need to have a schedule drawn up of what you will be checking and when.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction planning software features that can help with this:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team management feature will be very helpful for this step. This feature allows you to monitor task status, work activities, and track time.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Step 4: Track your performance</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the success of your construction planning internship, gather data on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as objectives, performance, and quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential that you accurately track the performance of your team on this construction project and ensure they are meeting the parameters you have set. And in the event of an unsuccessful construction planning project, it ensures you have data that you can dive into to figure out why you failed so it does not happen again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successful construction planning managers typically use </span><a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/project-management-kpis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key performance indicators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (KPIs) to monitor the performance of a project.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Some typical KPIs you can track include:</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project objectives: Are you on schedule and on budget?</span></p>
<p><b><i>Project performance</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is the рrоjeсt рrосeeding smооthly, оr аre yоu running intо sоme оbstасles yоu weren’t exрeсting?</span></p>
<p><b><i>Quality</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Sure, the crew is hitting their milestones, but is the work up to the quality that you want at this stage?</span></p>
<p><b><i>Construction planning software features that can help with this:</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many construction planning software options offer tracking tools, such as materials management or equipment tracking, not to mention the team-tracking options mentioned above. Use as many tracking tools as possible: More data is better than less.</span></p>
<p><b> Steр 5: Сlоse оut аnd evаluаte the рrоjeсt</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the dаtа yоu gаthered, evаluаte yоur рerfоrmаnсe аnd tаlk with yоur teаm оn hоw yоu соuld imрrоve оn the next рrоjeсt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just beсаuse the building is оver dоesn’t meаn yоu’re dоne with the рlаnning рrосess. The lessоns leаrned аnd dаtа gаthered frоm this рrоjeсt helр infоrm hоw yоu аррrоасh the next рrоjeсt, sо it’s imроrtаnt tо рerfоrm the сlоse-оut tаsks. This wоrk саn аlsо serve аs sоme оf the рre-соnstruсtiоn рlаnning fоr yоur next рrоjeсt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thаnks tо the fасt thаt yоu hаd а сleаrly-defined соnstruсtiоn рrоjeсt рlаn аnd а wаy tо trасk рerfоrmаnсe аnd оbstасles, yоu’re well-equiррed tо соnduсt аn even mоre suссessful соnstruсtiоn рlаnning рrосess the next time аrоund. Yоu’ll knоw where the оbstасles аre аnd whаt mistаkes were mаde, whiсh will then infоrm hоw yоu саn tweаk the next рlаn in оrder tо mаximize suссess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this shоuldn’t be а рrосess thаt tаkes рlасe just in yоur оwn heаd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call a final meeting with your crew to discuss how you performed. Соnduсt а brаinstоrming sessiоn tо get ideаs оn whаt yоu соuld hаve dоne better, аnd tаke extensive nоtes. They are yоur eyes аnd eаrs, sо dоn’t lоse the орроrtunity tо соlleсt their vаluаble insight.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1> Machine Learning in India 2024</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89" src="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/data-science.jpg" alt="Machine learning " width="2560" height="1000" /><a href="https://www.weforum.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The World Economic Forum</a> states that AI and ML specialists are one of the most emerging jobs in India. There has been a threefold increase in the demand for Machine Learning specialists in India as well. Owing to this, companies in India are not shying away from increasing machine-learning expert salary packages. </span></p>
<p><b><i>It is said that if we imagine machines as a baby, currently, in terms of ML, we stand where the machines are just learning how to crawl. However, soon, the machines will not just walk but fly.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before we get into machine-learning expert salary packages, let us look at what ML is all about in India.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a>?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning is a method that uses data analysis to automate analytical model building. This branch of artificial intelligence is based on the idea that systems can learn from data. They can identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although machine-learning expert salary packages are getting hiked today, ML is not a new concept. In fact, during World War II, Alan Turing developed the Enigma machine to break Germany’s code. Machine Learning is everywhere today. This has caused an increase in machine-learning expert salary packages.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why is Machine Learning important in India today?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we see what has caused the increase in machine-learning expert salary packages in India, we need to understand the importance of ML in India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important aim of ML is to enhance the overall productivity, functioning, and decision-making processes of organizations. As machines begin to learn through algorithms, businesses will unravel patterns within data. They offer high machine-learning expert salary packages to ensure that pattern recognition and performance enhancement is done without human intervention. Apart from these, ML has the following benefits which have caused a hike in machine-learning expert salary packages-</span></p>
<h3><b><i>1-Time Analysis and Assessment-</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML makes it easier for one to sift through large customer feedback and interaction databases. It helps organizations to conduct timely analysis and assessment of their strategies. When organizations hire specialists at high machine-learning expert salary packages, they create business models that browse through the data to see relevant variables.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>2-Real-time Predictions through Fast Processing</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML algorithms are super fast which makes data processing from multiple sources easy. This makes real-time predictions easy for organizations causing a hike in machine-learning expert salary packages in India.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Churn Analysis: </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance of reason for the rise in machine-learning expert salary packages in India is the ability to identify customer segments that are likely to drop your brand. This saves a lot of money for businesses.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Customer leads and conversion- </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way in which high machine-learning expert salary packages helps is that ML provides valuable insights into buying and spending patterns of customer segments. This enables businesses to minimize losses.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Customer Retention-  </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of high machine-learning expert salary packages, ML specialists can improve the strategies to improve customer experience.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>3-Transforming Industries</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML has started transforming industries with the ability to provide valuable real-time insights. Hence, it is obvious with increasing demand, there is a stark increase in machine-learning expert salary packages. Finance and insurance companies are leveraging ML to prevent fraud and provide customized financial plans to different customer segments by hiring at a high machine-learning expert salary package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML is also entering the healthcare sector in the form of wearables and fitnesses packages. This has caused a hike in high machine-learning expert salary packages in the healthcare industry to enable individuals to take charge of their health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owing to the above, there is a substantial need for ML engineers which, in turn, has caused an increase in machine-learning expert salary packages.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is one another major reason that has led to this spike in India.</span></p>
<h2><b>What has caused an increase in the machine-learning expert salary package?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aspiring Minds’  Annual Employability Survey states that 80% of engineers in India are not well-suited for our knowledge economy. Only 2.5% of engineers possess the skills to get high machine-learning expert salary packages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we need to understand what machine-learning engineers do and why there is an increase in machine-learning expert salary packages.</span></p>
<h2><b>What does a Machine Learning Engineer do?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A machine learning engineer is a job role similar to that of a data scientist. Both data scientists and ML specialists work with large data sets and need to possess excellent skill sets. Hence, both data scientists&#8217; salaries and machine-learning experts&#8217; salary packages are high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, ML engineers heavily focus on designing self-running software for predictive model automation. They ensure that the models used by data scientists extract meaningful insights leading to an increase in machine-learning expert salary.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several other reasons that have led to the spike in machine-learning expert salary such as the additional responsibilities they have.</span></p>
<h2><b>Machine-learning Expert Salary in India</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for ML is high but companies require candidates with the right skill sets. Hence, there is a demand to hike machine-learning expert salary packages.</span></p>
<h3><b><i>The average machine-learning expert salary in India is Rs. 686,281 according to Payscale.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, your machine-learning expert salary package depends on your skills and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The machine-learning expert salary package can go as low as Rs. 303,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the highest machine-learning expert salary is as high as Rs 2 million.</span></p>
<h1><b>Factors Affecting Machine-Learning Expert Salary in India</b></h1>
<p><b><i>1-Company</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger the brand, the higher the salary people can expect. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. offers about Rs. 4,42,000 whereas Intel Corporations offers a machine-learning expert salary package of 20,00,000.</span></p>
<p><b><i>2-Experience</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entry-level machine-learning expert salary in India is Rs. 501,058.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-level machine-learning expert salary in India is Rs. 1,142,459.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start from the start!</span></p>



<p><b>What does it mean when something is ‘Meta’?</b></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Write Meta Description for Websites and Blog Posts</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the term originally comes from the Greek prefix </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">meta-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meaning post, it is more commonly used to mean </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (its own category)</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you make a joke about jokes, it becomes a meta-joke.</span></p>



<p><b><i>So, by that logic, is #hashtag a meta hashtag? I guess so.</i></b></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>What are Meta Tags?</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta tags are essentially little content descriptors that tell search engines what a web page is about. Meta tags provide information about the webpage in the HTML document. This information is known as metadata. While this information is not displayed on the page itself, it can be read by search engines and people who know where to look</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing use meta-data from these meta tags to gain auxiliary information about the webpage. They can use this information for ranking purposes, to display snippets in search results, and sometimes they can just ignore these tags.</span></p>



<p><b><i>Hold up! So tags and meta tags are different?</i></b></p>



<p><b><i>Well, yes and no.</i></b></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>What is the Difference Between a Tag and a Meta Tag?</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know the use of tags you see. But, it is the tags that you do not see that might perplex you.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, their purpose is exactly the same.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is only one difference, and that is the location.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta tags only exist in the HTML file of a web page. They are added usually in the header of the HTML code. Ideally, these tags are read by the search engines only. However, if you are eager, you can also see these tags by right-clicking anywhere on the web page to open a menu. Select “view page source”. And, find your way to the head of the HTML document.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Do Meta Tags Actually Help SEO?</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know I am repeating myself, but yes and no.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta tags represent the beginning of most SEO training, for better or worse.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things everyone mentions in any article is the misuse of meta tags, mainly because they are at the top of every page and hence, they are the first thing that is apparent.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, every coin has two faces.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meta tags are one of the best tools in any search marketer’s quiver. And, I am here to prove it.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Types of Meta Tags&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are four main types of meta tags worth talking about, and I am going to talk about them all here. Some of them are not as useful as they once were. Others should be used regularly to increase your web traffic by letting Google know who you are and what you offer to the users.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a brief of the four types I will discuss:</span></p>



<p><b>1- Meta Keywords Attribute</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – A series of keywords you think are relevant to the page in question.</span></p>



<p><b>2- Title Tag</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – This is the text you’ll see in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) and at the top of your browser. Search engines see this text as the “title” for the page you have used it in.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3- </span><b>Meta Description Attribute</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – This is a nutshell description of the page.</span></p>



<p><b>4- Meta Robots Attribute</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> –&nbsp; This is an indication to search engine crawlers (robots or “bots”) telling what they need to do with your page.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Meta Keywords Attribute</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, the meta keyword tags might have been beneficial, but not anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, it is our own undoing.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Digital Marketing became a trendsetting field, marketers grew a little (correction: a lot) desperate for views on their pages. They started inserting keywords into their code that were totally unrelated to their pages. This was done in an attempt to pirate traffic from the pages which were more popular. This practice is known as</span><b><i> “keyword stuffing.”</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, what if you searched for Lindsay Lohan and you somehow landed on this page? Or maybe that is how you got here.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidding! No one can outsmart Google. Certainly, not us. And, neither could those fishy marketers.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Google decided to devalue this tool. Nowadays, Google doesn’t use meta keywords in its ranking algorithm at all.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Title Tag</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title tags-on the other hand are the most important of all the meta tags we have. While its name doesn’t start with ‘meta’, it is in the header and contains information that is very important to SEO. These tags have a real impact on search rankings and, perhaps just as importantly, are the only of tags mentioned here that are visible to the average user.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll find title tags in the search results pages and at the top of your browser.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is particularly useful if you want to give your page one primary title for the user to clarify information for SEO purposes or help them shuffle multiple tabs on their desktops.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Meta Description Attribute&nbsp;</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infamous meta description tag is used for one major purpose- to provide a description of your page to search engines and (sometimes) searchers themselves as they read through the SERPs. This tag does not actually influence the rankings of your page, but it is very important regardless.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the ad copy that will determine if users click on your result. Keep it within 160 characters, and write it to bait the user&#8217;s attention. Google has not implicitly said anything but actions speak louder than words. Although meta keywords don’t matter much, meta descriptions definitely do.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, sell your page — get them to click on the result.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Meta Robots Attribute</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this attribute, you’re telling the search engines what to do with your pages:</span></p>



<p><b>1- index/noindex –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This tells the engines whether to show your page in search results or not.</span></p>



<p><b>2- Follow/Nofollow –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This tells the engines what to do with links on your pages. It tells whether they should trust and follow the links to your next pages.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;In terms of indexing and link following, if you don&#8217;t specify a meta robots tag, they read that as an </span><b><i>index, follow.</i></b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, these search engines are really good at this kind of thing on their own, but if you think you need it, feel free.</span></p>



<p><b>Before You Leave</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that meta tags matter, but not all of them are on your side. Anyone with any knowledge of SEO would agree when I say that if you want to rank high in searches, your meta tags need to accompany high-quality content that focuses on user satisfaction (such as this blog, hopefully).</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, just stick to the core minimum. Refrain from adding meta tags you do not actually need — they just take up space and memory. The lesser code you keep, the better it is.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just imagine that your page code is a set of step-by-step directions to get somewhere but for a browser. Now, the irrelevant meta tags are the annoying &#8220;Go straight for 500 meters&#8221; that interrupts the beat drop of your favorite EDM song.</span></p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data Structure algorithm interview Question</strong></h1>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="730" height="480" data-id="299" src="https://www.skillvertex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/data-interview.png" alt="" class="wp-image-299"/></figure>

<p>Data structures and algorithms are fundamental ideas in computer science that are essential to effectively resolving challenging issues. A data structure is a method for organizing and storing data in a computer&#8217;s memory to facilitate effective information manipulation and retrieval. An algorithm, on the other hand, is a step-by-step process or a collection of guidelines for resolving a specific problem. Data structures and algorithms work as the foundation for creating software systems that are effective and optimized.</p>



<p>On the other side, algorithms are the set of guidelines or rules that specify how data is altered or processed. They include a broad range of methods, including graph traversal, search, sorting, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer. In order to be as simple as possible, an algorithm&#8217;s time complexity and memory requirements must be kept to a minimum. Programmers can enhance the functionality of their programmes by algorithmic analysis and design, making it possible for them to manage huge datasets, challenging computations, and real-time processing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&nbsp;11 interview Questions</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>How would you use a stack to reverse a string?</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These steps can be used to reverse a string using a stack:</p>



<p>Make a blank stack.</p>



<p>Go through each character in the string repeatedly.</p>



<p>Each character should be pushed onto the stack.</p>



<p>Pop each character from the stack and add it to a new string once you have reached the end of the previous string.</p>



<p>The original string&#8217;s reversed form will be used in the new string.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example implementation in Python:</p>



<p><strong>Example usage:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vhgevDOalXYegiKrhkwAG6szUi7D9UT_Vzc221oU00NIngbfn7yZGe1BRqxmjft45E5dSyjdN5EmfsMKTUeYIvDLNiJ59eZHb9h0zmgyGvK8EsPyhgTfQFE5NIg_K7i83gNRPFyWF08dt68MTPgeBms" alt=""/></figure>



<p>&nbsp;#&nbsp; Output: &#8220;!dlroW ,olleH&#8221;</p>



<p>In this example, the string &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; is reversed using a stack, resulting in the output &#8220;!dlroW ,olleH&#8221;.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. How does a priority queue work? Provide an example.</strong></h3>



<p>An abstract data type called a priority queue makes it possible to insert and remove components quickly according to their priority. Each item in the priority queue has a priority value assigned to it, and items with higher priorities are removed from the queue before items with lower priorities. A heap data structure is frequently used in the implementation of priority queues.</p>



<p>Here is a brief description of how a priority queue operates:</p>



<p>The priority queue receives the elements according to their distinct priorities.</p>



<p>Always at the head of the queue is the item with the highest priority.</p>



<p>The element with the following greatest priority moves to the front when an element is dequeued.</p>



<p>According to the implementation approach chosen (for example, first-in-first-out), elements with the same priority are handled differently.</p>



<p>Here is an illustration of how to create a priority queue in Python using the native heapq module:</p>



<p>python</p>



<p>Copy code</p>



<p>import heapq</p>



<p>class PriorityQueue:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self._queue = []</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self._index = 0</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def is_empty(self):</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Explain the concept of <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/sv-lab/">dynamic programming.&nbsp;</a></strong></h3>



<p>Using a bottom-up approach, dynamic programming is a strategy for addressing problems that divides larger, more complex problems into smaller, overlapping subproblems. By saving and reusing answers to subproblems and cutting out unnecessary computations, it reduces the time complexity. It entails establishing basic cases, recognising the problem, developing a table to store solutions, populating the table, and building the ultimate solution. Dynamic programming provides effective solutions by minimising superfluous calculations for problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. How would you implement a graph data structure?</strong></h3>



<p>Different methods can be used to implement a graph data structure. An adjacency list or adjacency matrix are two methods that are frequently used to represent a graph.</p>



<p>Adjacency List: In this method, we represent the graph&#8217;s vertices using an array or a hash map.</p>



<p>A list or an array that contains its neighboring vertices is linked to each vertex in the array/hash map.</p>



<p>Adjacency lists make it feasible to efficiently represent sparse graphs, which are those with a much lower number of edges than the total number of edges that can be present.</p>



<p>Here is a Python implementation example:</p>



<p>class Graph:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self):</p>



<p>self.graph = {}</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def add_vertex(self, vertex):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if vertex not in self.graph:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.graph[vertex] = []</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def add_edge(self, source, destination):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if source in self.graph and destination in self.graph:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.graph[source].append(destination)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.graph[destination].append(source)&nbsp; # For an undirected graph</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def get_neighbors(self, vertex):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if vertex in self.graph:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return self.graph[vertex]</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return []</p>



<p><strong># Example usage:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QtsdvCOtBl4WAlrm-vqahS_weOrGD-LmFxXvHEvJNoUrR85hsWf5biOeV9GmcaTmd-C7lXkm_eyVcXvIUSOrLwm1jZpTzRa8a-e5-AOMNu_UQGGVgArZ0C0yb2kM7ECx9mUbVgKGeLDlWiQwPifxHec" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong># Output: [&#8216;A&#8217;, &#8216;C&#8217;]</strong></p>



<p>Adjacency Matrix:</p>



<p>In this approach, we use a 2D matrix to represent the edges between vertices.</p>



<p>The rows and columns of the matrix correspond to the vertices, and the values in the matrix indicate the presence or absence of an edge between two vertices.</p>



<p>An adjacency matrix allows for efficient representation of dense graphs (where the number of edges is close to the maximum possible edges).</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example implementation in Python:</p>



<p>class Graph:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, num_vertices):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.num_vertices = num_vertices</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.graph = [[0] * num_vertices for _ in range(num_vertices)]</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def add_edge(self, source, destination):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if 0 &lt;= source &lt; self.num_vertices and 0 &lt;= destination &lt; self.num_vertices:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.graph[source][destination] = 1</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.graph[destination][source] = 1&nbsp; # For an undirected graph</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def get_neighbors(self, vertex):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if 0 &lt;= vertex &lt; self.num_vertices:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbors = []</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for i in range(self.num_vertices):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if self.graph[vertex][i] == 1:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbors.append(i)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return neighbors</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return []</p>

<p># Output: [0, 2]</p>



<p>These are two common approaches for implementing a graph data structure. The choice between an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix depends on the characteristics of the graph and the specific requirements of the problem at hand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. How would you check if a binary tree is a binary search tree?</strong></h3>



<p>You can use an inorder traversal and check the elements&#8217; order to see if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST). The inorder traversal of a binary search tree results in a sorted series of entries.</p>



<p>The following is a general approach to determine whether a binary tree is a binary search tree:</p>



<p>run the binary tree through an inorder traverse.</p>



<p>Compare each element with the one before it during the traversal.</p>



<p>The tree cannot be a valid BST if any element is smaller than or equal to its forerunner.</p>



<p>The tree is a valid BST if the traverse is completed with no violations.</p>



<p>Here is a Python implementation example:</p>



<p>class TreeNode:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, value):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.val = value</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.left = None</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.right = None</p>



<p>def is_bst(root):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stack = []</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prev = None&nbsp; # To store the previous element during traversal</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while root or stack:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while root:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stack.append(root)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root = root.left</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root = stack.pop()</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if prev and root.val &lt;= prev.val:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return False</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prev = root</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root = root.right</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return True</p>



<p><strong># Example usage:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AsYos0jFVJEEE0sZLaFdw5ZLGYInFcG1cdvOrqvpLG33bvTJ8WionrjLj_oPEIKcDnWtT0Qc0TnECL3AQUXrrlY4EL_2oi80xnc9tbToccvLRut9I9NiIj59Bbvu0Y4aM4n2V-NGB3SHWy77dCIo7mw" alt=""/></figure>



<p># Check if the tree is a binary search tree</p>



<p>if is_bst(root):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(&#8220;The binary tree is a binary search tree.&#8221;)</p>



<p>else:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(&#8220;The binary tree is not a binary search tree.&#8221;)</p>



<p>In this example, the binary tree is constructed with values that satisfy the properties of a BST. The algorithm performs an inorder traversal and checks if the elements are in ascending order. Since the traversal completes without any violations, it confirms that the tree is a valid binary search tree.</p>



<p>Please note that this algorithm assumes that the binary tree does not contain duplicate values. If the tree allows duplicate values, additional rules or constraints need to be considered to determine if it is a binary search tree.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Compare and contrast a stack and a queue.</strong></h3>



<p>&nbsp;A stack and a queue are both abstract data types used to store and retrieve elements, but they differ in their fundamental principles and operations:</p>



<p>Stack:</p>



<p>Principle: The stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.</p>



<p>Operations:</p>



<p>Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.</p>



<p>Pop: Removes and returns the topmost element from the stack.</p>



<p>Peek/Top: Returns the value of the topmost element without removing it.</p>



<p>Visualization: Imagine a stack of plates. You can only add or remove plates from the top.</p>



<p>Example usage: Function call stack, undo/redo operations.</p>



<p>Queue:</p>



<p>Principle: The queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.</p>



<p>Operations:</p>



<p>Enqueue: Adds an element to the back (or end) of the queue.</p>



<p>Dequeue: Removes and returns the frontmost (or first) element from the queue.</p>



<p>Front: Returns the value of the frontmost element without removing it.</p>



<p>Rear/Back: Returns the value of the rearmost element without removing it.</p>



<p>Visualization: Think of a queue of people waiting in line. New people join at the rear, and the person at the front is served and leaves.</p>



<p>Example usage: Task scheduling, breadth-first search.</p>



<p>Comparison:</p>



<p>Ordering: Stack follows LIFO, while queue follows FIFO.</p>



<p>Insertion and Deletion: Stacks allow for efficient insertion and deletion at one end (top), while queues allow for efficient insertion at one end (rear) and deletion at the other end (front).</p>



<p>Access: Stacks only allow access to the topmost element, while queues allow access to both the front and rear elements.</p>



<p>Usage: Stacks are useful for tracking function calls, managing recursive algorithms, and maintaining a history of actions. Queues are suitable for handling tasks in a sequential manner, managing resources, and breadth-first traversal of graphs.</p>



<p>Data Structure: Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Queues can also be implemented using arrays or linked lists.</p>



<p>In summary, while both stacks and queues are used to store and retrieve elements, their core principles (LIFO vs. FIFO) and associated operations (push/pop vs. enqueue/dequeue) differentiate their behaviors and applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Compare and contrast a min-heap and a max-heap.</strong></h3>



<p>A min-heap and a max-heap are both binary trees that satisfy the heap property, but they differ in how that property is defined:</p>



<p>Min-Heap:</p>



<p>Heap Property: In a min-heap, for any given node, the value of that node is smaller than or equal to the values of its children.</p>



<p>Root Element: The root element of a min-heap is the minimum element in the heap.</p>



<p>Operations:</p>



<p>Insertion: New elements are inserted at the next available position in the tree and then &#8220;bubbled up&#8221; if necessary to maintain the heap property.</p>



<p>Deletion: The minimum element (root) is removed from the heap, and the last element in the tree is moved to the root position. Then, the element is &#8220;bubbled down&#8221; if necessary to restore the heap property.</p>



<p>Use Cases: Min-heaps are commonly used for priority queues, where the element with the smallest priority value should be dequeued first.</p>



<p>Max-Heap:</p>



<p>Heap Property: In a max-heap, for any given node, the value of that node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.</p>



<p>Root Element: The root element of a max-heap is the maximum element in the heap.</p>



<p>Operations:</p>



<p>Insertion: New elements are inserted at the next available position in the tree and then &#8220;bubbled up&#8221; if necessary to maintain the heap property.</p>



<p>Deletion: The maximum element (root) is removed from the heap, and the last element in the tree is moved to the root position. Then, the element is &#8220;bubbled down&#8221; if necessary to restore the heap property.</p>



<p>Use Cases: Max-heaps are often used for priority queues, where the element with the largest priority value should be dequeued first. They can also be used in algorithms such as heap sort.</p>



<p>Comparison:</p>



<p>Ordering: In a min-heap, the minimum element is at the root, while in a max-heap, the maximum element is at the root.</p>



<p>Heap Property: In a min-heap, the value of any node is smaller than or equal to the values of its children, while in a max-heap, the value of any node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.</p>



<p>Insertion and Deletion: Both min-heaps and max-heaps use similar algorithms for insertion and deletion but with different comparisons based on the heap property.</p>



<p>Use Cases: Min-heaps and max-heaps have similar use cases, such as priority queues, but their respective heap properties determine whether the smallest or largest element is prioritized.</p>



<p>In summary, min-heaps and max-heaps differ in their heap property, the ordering of elements, and the way elements are compared during insertion and deletion. They are both efficient data structures for maintaining a partially ordered binary tree, and their specific properties make them suitable for different applications depending on whether the smallest or largest element is of interest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Describe the process of finding the first non-repeating character in a string.</strong></h3>



<p>The process of finding the first non-repeating character in a string involves iterating through the string and keeping track of the frequency of each character. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:</p>



<p>Create an empty hash map or dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the string.</p>



<p>Iterate through the string and update the frequency count for each character.</p>



<p>After the iteration, iterate through the string again and check the frequency count for each character.</p>



<p>Return the first character that has a frequency count of 1.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example implementation in Python:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3wFUBtjz-YYg_KfhHtlkfwcl3JDBVnnauzNIsaQ0Fv1aNo6IN00Je80Wvi_ybw0kzhxIWvUsEnF1EiEtQn-mKyhQx14NZdn0hzpfGaWDJmjvrzPNUx7l6PrjyT3rGGytqlYnEw815c0U9jqivtG82M0" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong># Output: &#8216;c&#8217;</strong></p>



<p>In this example, the string &#8220;abracadabra&#8221; is passed to the first_non_repeating_char function. The function counts the frequency of each character using a hash map. It then iterates through the string again and returns the first character that has a frequency count of 1, which is &#8216;c&#8217; in this case.</p>



<p>The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we iterate through the string twice. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of distinct characters in the string, as we store the frequency count in a hash map.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. How would you check if a linked list is a <a href="https://testbook.com/interview/dsa-interview-questions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">palindrome</a>?</strong></h3>



<p>To check if a linked list is a palindrome, you can utilize the concept of a two-pointer approach. Here&#8217;s the step-by-step process to solve this problem:</p>



<p>Find the middle node of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.</p>



<p>Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the node after the middle node.</p>



<p>Compare the values of the first half of the original linked list (from the start to the middle) with the reversed second half of the list.</p>



<p>If all the values match, the linked list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example implementation in Python:</p>



<p>class ListNode:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.val = val</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.next = next</p>



<p>def is_palindrome(head):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Find the middle node using the slow and fast pointer technique</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow = fast = head</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while fast and fast.next:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow = slow.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fast = fast.next.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Reverse the second half of the linked list</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prev = None</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while slow:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next_node = slow.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow.next = prev</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prev = slow</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow = next_node</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Compare the first half and the reversed second half</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_half = head</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second_half = prev</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while second_half:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if first_half.val != second_half.val:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return False</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_half = first_half.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second_half = second_half.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return True</p>



<p><strong># Example usage:</strong></p>

<p>else:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(&#8220;The linked list is not a palindrome.&#8221;)</p>



<p>In this example, a linked list with values 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 is created. The is_palindrome function uses the two-pointer approach to find the middle node, reverse the second half, and compare the first half with the reversed second half. Since all the values match, the function outputs that the linked list is a palindrome.</p>



<p>The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we iterate through the list twice. The space complexity is O(1) as we perform the operations in-place without using any additional data structures that grow with the size of the input.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. What is a circular linked list? How would you detect if a <a href="https://www.skillvertex.com/">linked list</a> is circular?</strong></h3>



<p>A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a loop or cycle. In other words, the &#8220;next&#8221; pointer of the last node points to a node earlier in the list, rather than being set to null as in a regular singly linked list.</p>



<p>To detect if a linked list is circular, you can use the concept of a slow and fast pointer. Here&#8217;s the step-by-step process:</p>



<p>Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, to the head of the linked list.</p>



<p>Move the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time.</p>



<p>If the linked list is not circular, the fast pointer will reach the end (null) before the slow pointer.</p>



<p>If the linked list is circular, the fast pointer will eventually &#8220;catch up&#8221; to the slow pointer and they will meet at some node.</p>



<p>If the fast pointer and slow pointer meet, it indicates that the linked list is circular.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example implementation in Python:</p>



<p>class ListNode:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.next = next</p>



<p>def is_circular(head):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if not head or not head.next:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return False</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow = head</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fast = head.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while fast and fast.next:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if slow == fast:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return True</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow = slow.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fast = fast.next.next</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return False</p>

<p>else:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(&#8220;The linked list is not circular.&#8221;)</p>



<p>In this example, a circular linked list is created with values 1, 2, 3, and 4. The last node points back to the second node, creating a loop. The is_circular function uses the slow and fast pointer approaches to detect circularity. Since the fast pointer eventually catches up to the slow pointer, indicating that they have met, the function outputs that the linked list is circular.</p>



<p>The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of additional memory for the two pointers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11. Describe the concept of recursion and provide an example.</strong></h3>



<p>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. In recursive algorithms, a base case is defined to stop the recursion and return a result, while the recursive case invokes the function on a smaller or simpler input to make progress towards the base case.</p>



<p>The key components of a recursive function are:</p>



<p>Base Case: The condition that defines the simplest form of the problem, where no further recursive calls are needed. It provides the stopping condition for the recursion.</p>



<p>Recursive Case: The condition that defines the problem in terms of smaller or simpler subproblems. It involves making one or more recursive calls with modified input parameters to eventually reach the base case.</p>



<p>Recursion is often used to solve problems that exhibit self-replicating or self-referencing structures, such as tree traversal, searching, sorting, and more.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example to demonstrate recursion in action:</p>



<p>def factorial(n):</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if n == 0 or n == 1:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Recursive case: factorial of n is n multiplied by factorial of (n-1)</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return n * factorial(n-1)</p>



<p><strong># Example usage:</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;# Output: 120</strong></p>



<p>In this example, the factorial function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. When factorial(n) is called, it checks if n is 0 or 1 (the base case). If so, it returns 1. Otherwise, it makes a recursive call to factorial(n-1) (the recursive case) and multiplies the result by n. This recursive process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the results are accumulated and returned.</p>



<p>When factorial(5) is called, it recursively calculates 5 * factorial(4), 4 * factorial(3), 3 * factorial(2), 2 * factorial(1), and finally 1 * factorial(0). Since the base case is encountered with factorial(0) and factorial(1), the recursive calls return their results, and the multiplication chain is resolved to give the final result of 120.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to ensure that a recursive function has proper termination conditions (base case) and that the recursive calls lead towards the base case. Otherwise, it can result in infinite recursion and stack overflow errors.</p>
