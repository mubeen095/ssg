<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="literals-in-c-c-with-examples">Literals In C/C++ With Examples</h2>



<p>Literals in the C and C++ programming languages are fundamental building blocks that represent constant values directly in code. These constants can include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Literals are essential for initializing variables, specifying values in expressions, and conveying data directly within the source code. They provide a means to express concrete values without requiring variables or complex computations. In this exploration of literals in C/C++, we will delve into the various types of literals and provide illustrative examples to demonstrate their usage and significance in these programming languages.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="literals-in-c-c">Literals In C/C++</h2>



<p>Literals in programming, whether in C or C++, are indeed constant values assigned to variables that remain fixed and unmodifiable throughout the program&#8217;s execution. Unlike variables, literals are not associated with references and directly hold their values in memory. In common usage, the terms &#8220;constants&#8221; and &#8220;literals&#8221; are often used interchangeably.</p>



<p>For instance, consider the expression &#8220;const int x = 5;,&#8221; where the value 5 is a constant integer literal. In the world of C, there are four primary types of literals, while in C++, there are five:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Integer Literal:</strong> Used to represent whole numbers, such as <code>42</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Float Literal:</strong> Represents decimal numbers with a fractional part, like <code>3.14</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Character Literal:</strong> Represents a single character enclosed in single quotes, such as <code>'A'</code>.</li>



<li><strong>String Literal:</strong> Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, like <code>"Hello, World!"</code>.</li>



<li><strong>Boolean Literal (C++):</strong> Represents either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, indicating logical values in C++.</li>
</ol>



<p>These literals play a pivotal role in coding by providing a concise way to embed fixed values directly into the source code, enhancing readability and maintainability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-integer-literals">1.Integer Literals </h2>



<p>Integer literals serve as a means to represent and store integer values in programming. They can be expressed in two primary types:</p>



<p>A) <strong>Prefixes:</strong> The use of prefixes with integer literals indicates the base or radix in which the literal is to be interpreted or read. These prefixes provide information about the numeric base of the integer value, which can be essential when working with numbers in different bases.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>0x10 = 16

Because 0x prefix represents a HexaDecimal base. So 10 in HexaDecimal is 16 in Decimal. Hence the value 16.</code></pre>



<p><strong>Integer Literals are of 2 types:</strong></p>



<p>a. <strong>Decimal-literal(base 10)</strong></p>



<p>It consists of a non-zero decimal digit followed by zero or more decimal digits, where decimal digits include the numbers 0 through 9. This is the common representation for integers in these programming languages, allowing you to express a wide range of positive integer values.</p>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>56, 78</code></pre>



<p><strong>&nbsp;b. Octal-literal(base 8):</strong></p>



<p>It begins with a &#8216;0&#8217; (zero) followed by zero or more octal digits, where octal digits include the numbers 0 through 7. This representation allows you to specify integer values in octal base, which is base 8. Octal literals are less commonly used than decimal literals but can be useful in certain situations, especially when dealing with permissions and bit manipulation.</p>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>045, 076, 06210</code></pre>



<p><strong>d. Binary-literal(base 2)</strong></p>



<p>It starts with either &#8216;0b&#8217; or &#8216;0B&#8217; followed by one or more binary digits, which are 0 and 1. This notation is used to represent integer values in binary base, which is base 2. Binary literals are valuable for expressing binary-encoded data or when working with low-level bit manipulation operations.</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>0b101, 0B111</code></pre>



<p>B) Suffix</p>



<p>Suffixes are added to the literal to specify its data type</p>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>12345678901234LL 

indicates a long long integer value 12345678901234 because of the suffix LL</code></pre>



<p>These are represented in many ways according to their data types.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>int:</strong> No suffix is required, as an integer constant is assigned as an <code>int</code> by default.</li>



<li><strong>unsigned int:</strong> Append &#8216;u&#8217; or &#8216;U&#8217; at the end of an integer constant.</li>



<li><strong>long int:</strong> Add &#8216;l&#8217; or &#8216;L&#8217; at the end of an integer constant.</li>



<li><strong>unsigned long int:</strong> Include &#8216;ul&#8217; or &#8216;UL&#8217; at the end of an integer constant.</li>



<li><strong>long long int:</strong> Use &#8216;ll&#8217; or &#8216;LL&#8217; as a suffix for an integer constant.</li>



<li><strong>unsigned long long int:</strong> Employ &#8216;ull&#8217; or &#8216;ULL&#8217; as a suffix for an integer constant.</li>
</ul>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  
int main()
{
  
    // constant integer literal
    const int intVal = 10;
  
    printf("Integer Literal:%d \n", intVal);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output <br></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Integer Literal:10
</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-floating-point-literals">2) Floating-Point Literals</h2>



<p>Floating-point literals are used to represent and store real numbers, which consist of an integer part, real part, fractional part, and exponential part. These literals can be represented in either decimal form or exponential form.</p>



<p>When creating floating-point literals, it&#8217;s essential to adhere to certain rules:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Decimal Form:</strong> If representing a floating-point number in decimal form, it should include the decimal point, exponent part, or both. Failing to include these components may result in an error.</li>



<li><strong>Exponential Form:</strong> When using exponential form, ensure that it includes the integer part, fractional part, or both, as required. Omitting any of these parts can lead to an error.</li>
</ol>



<p>Adhering to these guidelines helps maintain the accuracy and validity of floating-point literals, preventing potential errors in the code.</p>



<p> Floating-point literal representations are shown below:</p>



<p><strong>Valid Floating Literals:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>10.125
1.215-10L
10.5E-3</code></pre>



<p><strong>Invalid Floating Literals:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>123E
1250f
0.e879</code></pre>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
  
int main()
{
    // Real literal
    const float floatVal = 4.14;
  
    cout &lt;&lt; "Floating-point literal: "
         &lt;&lt; floatVal &lt;&lt; "\n";
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Floating point literal: 4.14
</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-character-literal">3) Character Literal</h2>



<p>Character literals are used to store a single character enclosed within single quotes (&#8221;). To store multiple characters, you would typically use a character array. Attempting to store more than one character within single quotes results in a warning, and only the last character of the literal is considered.</p>



<p>There are two primary representations of character literals:</p>



<p>A. <strong>char Type:</strong> This representation is used to store normal character literals or narrow-character literals. It is supported by both C and C++. Character literals of this type can hold a single character within single quotes and are widely used in both languages.</p>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// For C
char chr = 'G';

// For C++
char chr = 'G';</code></pre>



<p>B. <strong>wchar_t type:</strong> Unlike the &#8216;char&#8217; type, &#8216;wchar_t&#8217; is used to represent wide-character literals and is supported only in C++. When a character is followed by the &#8216;L&#8217; prefix, it indicates that the literal should be stored as a &#8216;wchar_t,&#8217; representing a wide-character literal. This is particularly useful for dealing with wide characters and character sets that require a larger storage space than regular narrow characters.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// Not Supported For C

// For C++
wchar_t chr = L'G';</code></pre>



<p>Example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  
int main()
{
    // constant char literal
    const char charVal = 'A';
  
    printf("Character Literal: %c\n",
        charVal);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output :</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Character Literal: A</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-string-literals">4) String Literals</h2>



<p>String literals indeed serve as containers for multiple characters and are enclosed within double quotes (&#8220;&#8221;). Unlike character literals, string literals can store sequences of characters, making them suitable for representing text and longer data.</p>



<p>String literals can also handle special characters and escape sequences, which are denoted by backslashes, such as &#8216;\n&#8217; for a newline or &#8216;\t&#8217; for a tab. This flexibility allows you to include various characters and control codes within a string.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>char greeting&#91;] = "Hello, World!";</code></pre>



<p>Example</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    // String literal
    char greeting&#91;] = "Hello, World!";

    // Printing the string literal
    printf("Message: %s\n", greeting);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>



<p>Output</p>



<p>Hello, World!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-boolean-literals">5) Boolean Literals</h2>



<p>.Boolean literals are specific to C++ and are used to represent boolean data types. These literals can have two values:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>true:</strong> This represents the &#8220;True&#8221; value and should not be considered equal to the integer 1, as it&#8217;s a distinct boolean value.</li>



<li><strong>false:</strong> This represents the &#8220;False&#8221; value and should not be considered equal to the integer 0, as it&#8217;s a distinct boolean value.</li>
</ol>



<p>Boolean literals are essential for writing clear and unambiguous code in C++ when working with boolean data types, making the code more expressive and readable.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C++ program to show Boolean literals
  
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
  
int main()
{
    const bool isTrue = true;
    const bool isFalse = false;
  
    cout &lt;&lt; "isTrue? "
        &lt;&lt; isTrue &lt;&lt; "\n";
    cout &lt;&lt; "isFalse? "
        &lt;&lt; isFalse &lt;&lt; "\n";
  
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>isTrue? 1
isFalse? 0

</code></pre>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q1. What is literals with example?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans. Literals are indeed constant values that are directly embedded in a program&#8217;s code and can be assigned to variables. Your example, &#8220;int count = 0;&#8221;, demonstrates this concept effectively.<br />In this statement, &#8220;int count&#8221; is the declaration of an integer variable named &#8216;count,&#8217; and the literal &#8216;0&#8217; directly represents the value assigned to this variable, which, in this case, is zero. Literals are a fundamental part of programming, helping to initialize variables and express fixed values within the code.</p>

<h4 class="rank-math-question ">Q2. How are literals stored in c?</h4>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>Ans.String literals are indeed stored in the program&#8217;s memory as a sequence of characters, and they are terminated by a null character (&#8216;\0&#8217;) with an ASCII value of 0. This null character marks the end of the string, allowing functions that operate on strings to determine where the string ends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="different-ways-to-declare-variable-as-constant-in-c-and-c">Different Ways To Declare Variable As Constant In C And C++</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="various-methods-to-declare-variable-constant">Various Methods to Declare Variable Constant </h2>



<p>There are various methods to make a variable constant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-const-keyword">1. Const keyword</h2>



<p> One way is by using the <code>const</code> keyword. When you declare a variable with <code>const</code>, it means that its value cannot be changed once it&#8217;s set, and this is determined at compile time.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C program to demonstrate const specifier
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
    const int num = 1;
  
    num = 5; // Modifying the value
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>When you declare a variable as <code>const</code> and then try to change its value, the compiler will generate an error similar to the one you mentioned: &#8220;error: assignment of read-only variable &#8216;num&#8217;.&#8221; This error is a safeguard to ensure that you don&#8217;t accidentally modify a constant variable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-enum-keyword">2. Enum keyword</h2>



<p><strong>The enum keyword</strong>:  is used to define an enumeration in C and C++. Enumerations allow you to assign names or labels to integral constants, making the code more readable and maintainable. Here&#8217;s an example of how you might use <code>enum</code> in C++:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// In C and C++ internally the default
// type of 'var' is int
enum VARS { var = 42 };
  
// In C++ 11 (can have any integral type):
enum : type { var = 42; }
  
// where mytype = int, char, long etc.
// but it can't be float, double or
// user defined data type</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-using-constexpr-keyword">3. Using&nbsp;constexpr&nbsp;keyword</h2>



<p> In C++, the constexpr keyword is used to declare variables as guaranteed constants. When you declare a variable, it must be initialized with a constant expression. This means that the value must be computable at compile time, not runtime. If the initializer of a <code>constexpr</code> variable isn&#8217;t a constant expression, the code will fail to compile. This helps ensure that <code>constexpr</code> variables are indeed constants that can be determined at compile time for optimization purposes.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
  
int main()
{
    int var = 5;
    constexpr int k = var;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; k;
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>If you attempt to initialize a <code>constexpr</code> variable with a value that cannot be determined at compile time, you will receive an error message like the one you mentioned: &#8220;error: the value of &#8216;var&#8217; is not usable in a constant expression.&#8221; This is a compiler error designed to enforce the rule that <code>constexpr</code> variables must be initialized with constant expressions.</p>



<p>If you want a variable to be a true constant, which means its value cannot be changed after initialization, you should declare it using the <code>const</code> keyword.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-using-macros">4. Using&nbsp;Macros</h2>



<p>Macros can be used to define constants in C and C++. However, there are some important considerations and potential issues when using macros for constants.</p>



<p>Macros in C and C++ are handled by the preprocessor, and they perform simple text replacement in your source code before it&#8217;s compiled. This text-based substitution means that macros lack type checking, and they can indeed be redefined or changed throughout your codebase, leading to potential errors and unexpected behavior.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// C++ program to demonstrate the problems
// in 'Macros'
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
  
#define var 5
int main() {
    printf("%d ", var);
  
    #ifdef var
    #undef var
  
    // redefine var as 10
    #define var 10
    #endif
  
    printf("%d", var);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>



<p>Output </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><strong>Output:</strong> 5 10</code></pre>



<p><strong>Note :</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Preprocessor Macros:</strong> Preprocessor macros are essentially text replacements and are suitable for defining literal constants. They are not associated with any specific data type or memory location. They are primarily used for simple text substitution and should be avoided for more complex constant requirements.</li>



<li><strong>Enums:</strong> Enums provide symbolic names for integral constants and are suitable for defining integer constants. Enums do not have specific memory addresses and are typically used for making code more readable and maintainable.</li>



<li><strong><code>const</code> and <code>constexpr</code>:</strong> <code>const</code> and <code>constexpr</code> are used to define true constants with specific memory addresses. They provide type safety and are the recommended way to define constants when you need them to have a particular data type and memory location. <code>const</code> is used for runtime constants, while <code>constexpr</code> is used for compile-time constants.</li>
</ol>



<p>In practice, <code>const</code> and <code>constexpr</code> are preferred for defining constants when you need type safety, memory control, and more versatile constant values. Preprocessor macros and enums have their use cases but may not offer the same level of control and safety as <code>const</code> and <code>constexpr</code>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-install-c">How To Install C++</h2>



<p>If you want to start using C++ on your laptop, you&#8217;re in the right place. C++ is a programming language used for creating all sorts of software. Whether you&#8217;re new to programming or already experienced, this guide will help you easily install C++ on your laptop. When you&#8217;re done, your laptop will be ready for C++ programming, and you can begin your coding adventure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-c">What is C ++</h2>



<p>C++ is a versatile programming language known for its unique characteristics. It&#8217;s a language that&#8217;s statically typed, meaning you need to declare variable types before using them. It&#8217;s compiled, which means the code is translated into machine-readable instructions before execution. C++ is a general-purpose language, so it can be used for a wide range of applications.</p>



<p>One interesting thing about C++ is that it&#8217;s case-sensitive, so capitalization matters in your code. It supports various programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</p>



<p>C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup back in 1979 at Bell Labs. It started as an improvement to the C language and was initially called &#8220;C with Classes.&#8221; However, in 1983, it got its current name, C++.</p>



<p>An important thing to note is that C++ is a superset of C. This means that almost any valid C program can also be a valid C++ program. This feature allows for easy migration and compatibility between the two languages.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="object-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming </h2>



<p>C++ is a programming language that offers robust support for object-oriented programming, encompassing the essential principles known as the four pillars of object-oriented development:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: C++ allows you to encapsulate or wrap data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. This promotes data security and prevents unauthorized access or modification of data.</li>



<li><strong>Data Hiding</strong>: With C++, you can hide the internal implementation details of a class and expose only the necessary interfaces or public methods. This concept, known as data hiding, ensures that the complexity of the class is hidden from users, promoting simplicity and ease of use.</li>



<li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: C++ supports inheritance, allowing you to create new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). Inheritance enables code reuse and the establishment of relationships between classes, making it a powerful feature for building complex software systems.</li>



<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: Polymorphism in C++ allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This facilitates flexibility and extensibility in your code, as you can create functions and methods that work with objects of multiple derived classes without knowing their specific types.</li>
</ol>



<p>These four pillars are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming and are essential for building modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems using C++.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-ansi-standard">The ANSI Standard</h2>



<p>The ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard for C++ serves a crucial purpose in the world of programming. It aims to guarantee the portability of C++ code across various platforms and compilers. This means that code you write for one specific compiler, such as Microsoft&#8217;s, should be able to compile without issues when using a different compiler on various systems, including Mac, UNIX, Windows, or Alpha.</p>



<p>The ANSI standard has remained consistent and unchanging for a significant period. Additionally, it has gained widespread acceptance and adoption in the programming community. As a result, all major C++ compiler manufacturers have aligned their implementations with the ANSI standard. This ensures that developers can write C++ code with confidence, knowing that it should work consistently across different environments and compiler brands. This portability is a valuable feature of the language, promoting code reuse and reducing platform-specific issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="learning-c">Learning C++</h2>



<p>When learning C++, it&#8217;s essential to focus on understanding the basic concepts. The main goal of learning a programming language like C++ is to become a better programmer. This means getting better at designing and building new systems, as well as maintaining existing ones.</p>



<p>C++ allows you to code in different styles, like Fortran, C, Smalltalk, or others. Each style can be effective and efficient in terms of how it uses computer resources. This flexibility lets you choose the coding style that works best for your projects and preferences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-of-c">Advantages Of C++</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>C++ is a widely adopted programming language, with a vast community of programmers using it across various application areas.</li>



<li>It finds extensive use in tasks that involve writing device drivers and software requiring direct interaction with hardware while adhering to real-time constraints.</li>



<li>C++ is also a popular choice for educational and research purposes because it offers a clean and understandable syntax, making it suitable for teaching fundamental programming concepts effectively.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever used an Apple Macintosh or a Windows PC, you&#8217;ve indirectly interacted with C++. This is because the core components of these systems, including their user interfaces, are built using C++.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="steps-to-download-c">Steps To Download C++</h2>



<p>To get started with C++ programming, you&#8217;ll need a C++ compiler. There are several compilers available, and one option is Turbo C++. Here are the steps to install Turbo C++:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Download Turbo C++</strong>: First, download the Turbo C++ software from a trusted source.</li>



<li><strong>Create a Directory</strong>: Create a directory called &#8220;turboc&#8221; inside your C drive (usually C:).</li>



<li><strong>Extract Files</strong>: Extract the contents of the downloaded tc3.zip file into the &#8220;C:\turboc&#8221; directory.</li>



<li><strong>Run the Installation</strong>: Locate and double-click on the &#8220;install.exe&#8221; file within the &#8220;C:\turboc&#8221; directory to start the installation process.</li>



<li><strong>Launch Turbo C++</strong>: After the installation is complete, you can launch Turbo C++. To do this, navigate to the &#8220;C:\TC\BIN&#8221; directory and find the &#8220;tc.exe&#8221; or &#8220;tcw.exe&#8221; application file. Double-click on it to open the Turbo C++ environment.</li>
</ol>



<p>Now, you&#8217;re ready to write and compile C++ programs using Turbo C++. Simply open the Turbo C++ environment, create a new project or source code file, write your C++ code, and use the built-in compiler to compile and run your programs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-no-need-for-coding-skills">2.No Need for Coding Skills</h3>



<p>SQL offers the advantage of streamlined data extraction without the need for extensive and convoluted code. Unlike other programming languages, SQL&#8217;s approach doesn&#8217;t demand intricate coding skills, simplifying database maintenance. This simplicity extends to data extraction, where SQL&#8217;s English-like statements facilitate easy comprehension and usage. Basic keywords such as SELECT, INSERT INTO, DELETE, and UPDATE allow for efficient operations. The language&#8217;s uncomplicated syntactical rules contribute to its user-friendly nature, making SQL an accessible choice for learners and professionals alike.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-portable">3. Portable</h3>



<p>Portability is a coveted aspect in data-storing programs, and SQL excels here. It seamlessly fits into various platforms &#8211; PCs, servers, tablets, laptops, and even certain mobile devices like Windows, Linux, and Mac. It&#8217;s adaptable for embedding in other programs and is versatile on local and internet systems. SQL&#8217;s data can move effortlessly between devices, ensuring easy accessibility and continuity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-standardized-language">4. Standardized Language</h3>



<p>SQL, the query language for relational databases, holds global recognition, being endorsed by ISO and ANSI. Its extensive documentation and established history offer users a uniform platform universally.</p>



<p>In the years 1986 and 1987, ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Standards Organization) respectively standardized SQL. The language&#8217;s latest standard, finalized in 2011, reinforces its relevance and consistency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-interactive-language">5. Interactive Language</h3>



<p>SQL is an approachable domain language, easy to grasp and interact with. It swiftly handles complex queries when interfacing with databases.</p>



<p>Its intuitive commands cater to various needs, making it user-friendly even for non-programmers. SQL&#8217;s utility extends to building and managing sizable databases, facilitating data sharing, updates, and retrieval across tables.</p>



<p>This adaptability drives its adoption across domains like web development, data analysis, and IT support, underscoring its significance in organizational applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-multiple-data-views">6. Multiple Data Views</h3>



<p>SQL bestows upon each user a custom data outlook. These perspectives reside within views—SQL statements storing specific queries in the database. These views can arise from single or multiple tables, molded by bespoke queries or intended outcomes.</p>



<p>In the realm of SQL, users access unique interpretations of the database&#8217;s structure and content, tailoring their experience to their requirements and enriching their data interactions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-internet-usage">7. Internet Usage</h3>



<p>SQL architecture integrates smoothly with three-tier Internet setups, consisting of client, application server, and database components.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="disadvantages-of-sql">Disadvantages Of SQL</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-resource-intensive-scaling">1. Resource-Intensive Scaling</h3>



<p>In SQL databases, vertical scaling involves investing in more powerful hardware, a costly and time-intensive process. Horizontal scaling, achieved through partitioning, is an alternative when needed. However, this approach introduces added intricacies, demanding more time and resources. Dealing with substantial databases often necessitates coding and skilled developers, further raising costs. Scaling SQL databases in response to growing data becomes akin to an endless chase, where the ideal setup remains elusive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-partial-control">2. Partial Control</h3>



<p>Programmers using SQL might find themselves lacking full control over databases. This limitation often stems from concealed corporate regulations and guidelines.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-cost-inefficient">3. Cost Inefficient</h3>



<p>Certain versions of SQL can be costly, preventing programmers from accessing them. A case in point is SQL Server Standard, which comes with an annual price tag of approximately $1,418.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-rigidity">4. Rigidity</h3>



<p>A SQL database necessitates a predefined schema for utilization. Once established, these schemas remain inflexible, making alterations intricate and time-intensive. Consequently, substantial effort is required in initial setup before the database can be operational.</p>



<p>SQL databases are most effective when data is structured, and significant changes in volume or data type aren&#8217;t anticipated. They are suited for situations where data remains relatively stable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-normalization-of-data">5. Normalization of Data</h3>



<p>Relational databases, born during an era of costly data storage, aimed to curb data redundancy. Individual tables hold distinct data that can be connected and queried through shared values. Nevertheless, as SQL databases expand, the lookups and joins required across numerous tables can lead to performance challenges, resulting in slowdowns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-hardware-updation">6. Hardware Updation</h3>



<p>The prevalent approach for SQL databases is vertical scaling, involving augmenting capacity by adding capabilities like RAM, CPU, and SSD to the current server or moving to a larger one, albeit pricier. As your data grows, necessitating increased storage and faster equipment for evolving technologies, hardware upgrades become essential. Database vendors often mandate hardware upgrades for running their latest releases.</p>



<p>However, this trajectory risks rapid obsolescence, as each update proves costly and resource-intensive. The hardware demands of SQL databases encompass ongoing maintenance and operational expenses, contributing to the overall cost landscape.</p>

<p>print (&#8220;\n&#8221; * 10) </p>



<p>print(&#8220;Screen Cleared&#8221;)</p>



<p> clrscr()</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="output-2">Output </h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Screen Cleared</code></pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Code Explanation </h4>



<p>In the previous example, we utilize &#8221; \n&#8221; with the print function to clear specific lines on the screen. This adds a new line character and effectively clears the desired number of lines.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="clear-screen-program-by-using-os-system-method">Clear Screen Program by using OS.System method</h2>



<p>Different operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS require specific commands to clear the screen. We use the &#8216;_&#8217; variable to store the last expression.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s explore os. system for smooth screen clearing in Python. It involves using the os. system command to execute specific actions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code-3">Code </h3>



<p># Python program to clear the screen using os.system </p>



<p># Import os module </p>



<p>import os</p>



<p> def <strong>clrscr</strong>()</p>



<p>: # Check if Operating System is Mac and Linux or Windows </p>



<p>if os.name == &#8216;posix&#8217;:</p>



<p> _ = os.system(&#8216;clear&#8217;) </p>



<p>else: </p>



<p>      # Else Operating System is Windows (os.name = not)</p>



<p>     _ = os.system(&#8216;cls&#8217;) </p>



<p>        print(&#8220;Screen Cleared&#8221;) </p>



<p>clrscr()</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="output-4">Output </h3>



<p>Screen Cleared</p>



<p>Code Explanation: </p>



<p>After applying the syntax above, the output displays &#8220;Screen Cleared.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the initial example, we check the operating system using the os. name method. If it&#8217;s Linux or Mac (os.name = &#8220;posix&#8221;), we execute os. system(&#8216;clear&#8217;). Otherwise, for other systems, we use os.system(&#8216;cls&#8217;).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="using-subprocess-library">Using Subprocess Library<br></h2>



<p>In this example, we have used the&nbsp;<kbd>subprocess()</kbd>&nbsp;function to execute an action for clearing the screen in output.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="input">Input</h3>



<p># Python program to clear the screen using subprocess.call() function</p>



<p> # Import subprocess library </p>



<p>import subprocess </p>



<p>def <strong>clrscr</strong>(): </p>



<p>      cls = subprocess.call(&#8216;cls&#8217;,shell=True) </p>



<p>      print(&#8220;Screen Cleared&#8221;) </p>



<p>clrscr()</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="output-5">Output </h3>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Screen Cleared</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>



<p>Numerous ways exist to clear the Python screen without errors. However, using the click library is remarkably simple and versatile. It smoothly operates on Unix, Windows, and macOS, eliminating the need for OS checks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-difference-between-binary-search-and-linear-search">What Is The Difference Between Binary Search And Linear Search?</h2>



<p>Welcome to our exploration of two fundamental search algorithms: binary search and linear search. In the realm of computer science and programming, these techniques play pivotal roles in efficiently locating specific elements within a collection of data. Whether you are an aspiring programmer, a curious enthusiast, or a seasoned developer seeking a refresher, this article will delve into the key distinctions and inner workings of binary search and linear search. </p>



<p>Join us as we embark on a journey to unravel the mysteries behind these search algorithms and discover when and how to best utilize them in solving real-world problems. Let&#8217;s dive in and understand the fundamental differences between these two essential methods of data retrieval.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="linear-search">Linear Search </h2>



<p>Linear search, also called sequential search, is a way to find something in a random list of stuff. You start from the beginning and check each item one by one. If you find what you&#8217;re looking for, you tell the position. If not, you keep going until the end of the list. If you still can&#8217;t find it, you say &#8220;Sorry, I couldn&#8217;t find it&#8221; by returning -1. It&#8217;s a simple method, but it can take a while for large lists or if the thing you want is far down the list. There are smarter ways to find things faster, but this is the basic one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code-syntax-for-the-linear-search">Code Syntax for the Linear Search.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><code>/ Linear Search in C++</code><br><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code><br><code>usingnamespacestd;</code><br><code>intsearch(intarray[], intn, intx){&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Going through array sequencially&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;for(inti = 0; i &lt; n; i++)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(array[i] == x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>returni;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>return-1;}</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="binary-search">Binary Search </h2>



<p>In binary search, we use a smarter way to find something in a sorted list. Instead of checking each item one by one like in linear search, we start by looking at the middle item of the list. If the middle item is what we&#8217;re looking for, great, we&#8217;re done! But if it&#8217;s not, we know whether the item we want is in the first half or the second half of the list.</p>



<p>So, we cut down our search to half right away. If the middle item is greater than what we&#8217;re looking for, we know the item we want must be in the first half of the list. Otherwise, it must be in the second half. Hence, Binary search is more efficient than linear search, especially for large sorted lists, because it eliminates half of the remaining search space at each step, searching faster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code-syntax-for-the-binary-search">Code Syntax for the Binary Search</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code><br><code>usingnamespacestd;</code><br><code>intbinarySearch(intarray[], intx, intlow, inthigh){&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>// Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;// other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>while(low &lt;= high) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intmid = low + (high - low) / 2;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(array[mid] == x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returnmid;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;if(array[mid] &lt; x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;low = mid + 1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;high = mid - 1;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code><br><code>&nbsp;return-1;</code><br><code>}</code></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="main-difference-of-linear-search-and-binary-search">Main Difference Of Linear Search and Binary Search</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><em>Linear Search </em></strong></td><td><strong><em>Binary Search</em></strong></td></tr><tr><td>In linear search, input data doesn&#8217;t need to be sorted .</td><td>Whereas, in binary search, input data has to be sorted according to the order.</td></tr><tr><td>It is also referred as sequential search.</td><td>It is also referred to as half-interval search.</td></tr><tr><td>The time complexity of the linear search is O(n)</td><td>The time complexity of the binary search is<br> 0 (logn)</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-dimensional array is used for linear search.</td><td>A single dimensional array is used for linear search.</td></tr><tr><td>It operates equality comparisons</td><td>Binary search operates ordering comparisons</td></tr><tr><td>Linear search is less complex and involves a slow process </td><td>Binary search is more complex and has a fast process</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">Conclusion </h2>



<p>Linear search is simple and works with any type of list, whether it&#8217;s sorted or not. It checks each item one by one, starting from the beginning, until it finds the target item or reaches the end of the list. While easy to understand, it may be slow for large lists, especially if the item is far down the list.</p>



<p>On the other hand, binary search is more efficient, but it requires the list to be sorted. It starts by checking the middle item and narrows down the search to half the list based on whether the target item is greater or smaller than the middle. It keeps repeating this process, cutting down the search space in half with each step, until it finds the target or can&#8217;t narrow it down further. Binary search is ideal for large sorted lists, as it quickly finds the target item.</p>



<p>In summary, use linear search for small or unsorted lists, and binary search for large sorted lists when you need faster results. Each method has its strengths, and understanding their differences helps you choose the right approach for your specific problem.</p>
