Moreover, we know that C language is mainly used for desktop-based application and is high level programming language which is made for developing several applications. In contrast, Embedded C is the extension of the C programming language. Let us take a look at the difference between Embedded C and C.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"functions-of-c-language\">Functions of C Language <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>a. Used to develop desktop-based applications <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b. C programming language can generate .exe files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c. It has unlimited resources such as memory <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>d.

Making changes in C language is easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>f. Fixing bugs is easy <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e.  In C  programming language, it is possible to give input to the program while running.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"functions-of-embedded-c\">Functions of Embedded C <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>a.

What is the difference between C and Embedded C Quora?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. There is only one C language.\u00a0If you use C on computers then it is called regular C.\u00a0If you use C on Electronics then it is called &#8220;Embedded C&#8221;. In both the  cases the compiled C program is executed by the Microprocessor only.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1691387346988\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q2. Why C is used in embedded systems, not C++?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. C is this low-level programming language is often used for embedded software development since it offers efficient memory management and hardware access. It is also a simpler language than C++ and can be easier to learn<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1691387453483\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q3. Which language is best for embedded system?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. Due to its effectiveness, C is the most used embedded computer programming language. The C programming language is used to create around 80% of embedded devices. It is portable, irrespective of the type of processor, and structured. Without a lot of adjustments, it might run on several systems.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What Are The Key Difference Between Embedded C And C ?
