It is mainly focused on handling file-related input\/output operations and console input\/output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.&lt;stdlib.h&gt; (Standard Library):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This header file provides functions for memory management and general utilities. It includes declarations for functions like malloc(), free(), and other functions for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation, as well as various utility functions. It is primarily used for memory allocation and freeing functions and other general-purpose functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The differentiation between these two header files, with &lt;stdio.h&gt; being for &#8220;File related Input\/Output&#8221; functions and &lt;stdlib.h&gt; for &#8220;Memory Allocation\/Freeing&#8221; functions, is a good way to understand their primary purposes. Developers include these header files in their C programs as needed, depending on the functionality they require.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In C, the association with UNIX history is indeed reflected in its treatment of keyboard input and display output as &#8220;files.&#8221; This concept is rooted in the Unix philosophy of &#8220;everything is a file,&#8221; where input and output streams are treated similarly to files. Keyboard input is often associated with the default stdin file stream, and display output is associated with the default stdout file stream. This concept simplifies handling input and output, making it consistent with file operations. While &lt;stdlib.h&gt; does include memory-related functions like malloc() and free(), it also contains other utility functions such as atoi() for string-to-integer conversion, exit() for program termination, and rand() for random number generation. So, it&#8217;s a versatile header file that goes beyond memory management functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, header files can contain not only function declarations but also definitions of constants, variables, macros, and custom data types. Header files are used to summarize and share common code among multiple source files in a C program, making it easier to maintain and reuse code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>stdio.h<\/th><th>stdlib.h<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1.<\/strong><\/td><td>stdio. h is referred to as  Standard Input Output<\/td><td>stdio. h is referred to as  Standard Library<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>2.<\/strong><\/td><td>stdio. h contains information regarding input and output functions.<\/td><td>Whereas, functions of stdlib. h are&nbsp;<strong>malloc , &nbsp;free ,abort , exit , <\/strong>etc.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>3.<\/strong><\/td><td>stdlib. h is only used when we need to allocate memory in our program.<\/td><td>Whereas, functions of stdlib. h are&nbsp;<strong>malloc , &nbsp;free ,abort , exit , <\/strong>etc.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>4.<\/strong><\/td><td>stdlib.h is only used when we need to allocate memory in our program.<\/td><td> Functions of stdio. h are&nbsp;<strong>printf, scanf<\/strong>&nbsp;,<strong>getc, putc ,&nbsp;<\/strong>etc<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"> <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"faq-whats-the-difference-between-header-files-stdio-h-and-stdlib-h\">FAQ-  What\u2019s The Difference Between Header Files \u201cStdio.h\u201d And \u201cStdlib.h\u201d ?<\/h2>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1699254229595\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q1. What is the use of Stdlib H header file?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. &lt;stdlib.h> is a standard C header file that&#8217;s part of the C Standard Library.
