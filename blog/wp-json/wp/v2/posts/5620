To be eligible, aspiring data scientists usually need a degree in a STEM field\u2014science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. This educational background is crucial as it provides the necessary foundation for the analytical and problem-solving skills vital in data science. Exploring the criteria and requirements for data science reveals the key qualifications that pave the way for a fulfilling journey into this dynamic and ever-growing field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"future-scope-of-data-science\">Future Scope Of Data Science<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data democratization is rapidly changing our world. Every industry as well as governments around the world will be acting on a wide variety of data sources. Businesses have undergone major transformations with insights and predictions powered by data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aforementioned changes led to the requirement for data science professionals across various industry verticals that had rapidly shifted. Businesses are having to rethink hiring, training, and partnerships. The latest demand is for a group of professionals who are skilled in data, analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, data science is a highly employable and appealing profession.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong> Therefore, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the shifting demands of the current job market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 2026, the demand for data science will be raised to around 11.5 million job openings. However, the industry has witnessed  650% growth since 2012 and is believed to have another rapid growth in the coming years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"data-science-course-eligibility\"><strong>Data Science Course Eligibility<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Meeting the increasing demand for data scientists requires higher education to be adaptable and responsive. Certifications, degree programs, and executive-level courses must align closely with the workforce&#8217;s needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, who can become a data scientist? The answer is simple\u2014anyone willing to learn data science, whether they are newcomers or experienced professionals. Engineers, software and IT professionals, and those in marketing can all enroll in part-time or external data science programs. Now, let&#8217;s look at the eligibility criteria for data science courses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For regular data science courses, a basic understanding of high school-level subjects is the minimum requirement. Since data science incorporates concepts from computer science, mathematics, and statistics, aspiring learners should aim to earn a degree in one of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) backgrounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ones who are learning computer programming in high school can take advantage of this in the future while pursuing data science. Due to the subject knowledge in programming, statistics, or machine learning, learners have become experts in the practical implementations of data science methodologies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals from other streams, like business studies, can study relevant courses in data science.<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Hence, anyone with a degree in business administration, such as a BBA or MBA, is eligible for higher studies in the data science domain. These professionals will work in the capacity of executives and be responsible for generating customer relationship management (CRM) reports, business-related data quality assessment (DQA), and management information systems (MIS).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"data-scientist-qualifications-and-skills\"><strong>Data Scientist Qualifications and Skills<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those considering a career in data science, certain prerequisites and skills are crucial:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Degree:<\/strong> Graduation in the STEM stream has a solid foundation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mathematics:<\/strong> Foundational to machine learning, data science, and data analysis, mathematics encompasses algebra, statistics, calculus, differentiation, probability, arithmetics, and geometry.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Statistics:<\/strong> This subject will allow for understanding, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Data Visualization:<\/strong> After accessing and retrieving data, visualization is essential.
