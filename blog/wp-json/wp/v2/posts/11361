The hiring process will consider the number of candidates and the colleges participating in the TCS (Tata Consultancy Services).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we don&#8217;t know about the cut-off &#8211;  Tata Consultancy Services(TCS). The fixed score or the required percentage needed to pass the NQT(National Qualifier Test ) is unknown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"factors-determining-the-cutoff-of-the-tcs-nqt\">Factors Determining the Cutoff of the TCS NQT<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The may Cut- off will be predicted by Tata Consultancy Services according to the following factors given below<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong>Difficulty Level of the Test: <\/strong>After analyzing how difficult the questions in the test were, TCS adjusts the cutoff score accordingly. If the test was relatively easy, the cutoff may be higher, if it was challenging, the cutoff may be lower. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>2. Number of Candidates and Their Performance:<\/strong> The cutoff score is influenced by the total number of candidates who took the test and how well they performed. It is mainly calculated according to the number of candidates who scored high, the cutoff may be higher to select the top performers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Target Number of Hires: <\/strong>TCS  will hire 10,000 freshers from the NQT. Based on this target and the performance of the candidates, they determine the cutoff score to select the desired number of candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tcs-nqt-scorecard-2024\">TCS NQT Scorecard 2024<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TCS NQT Score card will tell you about your performance in the NQT Exam. Whereas, there&#8217;s no section-wise Cut-off or overall cut-off by the Tata Consultancy Services. Every candidate who appears for the TCS NQT Exam will get the TCS NQT Score, which will indicate the performance of the different sections in the examination. After knowing the TCS NQT Score, candidates can choose the company they need to apply. TCS NQT Score can determine which companies you can look to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, this TCS NQT Scorecard will decide which companies interview you can attend. This scorecard is the key to your desired companies. Candidates can apply again for a better TCS NQT score. TCS NQT has four attempts in a year. Remember that, TCS NQT Score is valid for the two years from the issue. Candidates should prepare thoroughly to score well in the TCS Examination. You can also prepare for your next attempt with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/tcs-nqt-mock-test\/\">TCS NQT Mock test<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the percentage needed to pass the TCS NQT cut-off will depend on the number of candidates who appeared in the examination. The minimum percentage to score in the TCS NQT Exam is 60% marks. Candidates need to score 60% marks in the different sections of the TCS NQT  Exam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-next-after-the-tcs-nqt-result\">What next after the TCS NQT Result?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting the TCS NQT Result, candidates can attempt the interview with different companies according to the TCS NQT Scorecard. Carry the TCS NQT Scorecard before going for the TCS NQT Interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: <\/strong>If you score above the cutoff set by the company in their online aptitude test, you will receive an email from them. This email will contain a link that allows you to apply for the job. Companies that accept the TCS NQT Score include &#8211; TCS, Reliance, Tata Motors, Tata Electric, and Ramco.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> If you are still interested in the job role and wish to proceed further, go to TCS NQT&#8217;s official website and fill out the application form. This form will require you to enter details about yourself, such as your personal information, educational qualifications, work experience (if any), and other relevant details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> After you have submitted the application form, the company will review your resume and the information you provided. If they find your profile suitable for the role, they will send you another email, typically as an interview call letter. This email will contain details about the interview process, such as the date, time, and interview (in-person or virtual).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that receiving an interview call does not guarantee a job offer. The interview is the next step in the selection process, where the company will assess your skills, knowledge, and suitability for the role through various rounds of interviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"important-links-tcs-nqt-result-2024\">Important Links- TCS NQT Result 2024<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-exam-analysis\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9072\">TCS NQT Exam Analysis 2024,17th April, All Shifts<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-companies\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8747\">TCS NQT Companies List 2024, Check Complete List<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-interview-questions-and-answers\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8562\">Top 10 TCS NQT Interview Questions and Answers 2024<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-eligibility-criteria\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8498\">TCS NQT Eligibility Criteria 2024, Qualification, Percentage<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-salary\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8692\">TCS NQT Salary 2024 For Freshers, Salary Structure, In Hand Salary<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-syllabus\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8849\">TCS NQT Exam Syllabus PDF  Download 2024<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-coding-question\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8717\">Top  10 TCS NQT Coding Questions, and Answers<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/tcs-nqt-application-link\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8449\">TCS NQT Apply 2024, Application Link<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tcs-nqt-result-2024-fa-qs\">TCS NQT Result 2024- FAQs<\/h2>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1716964967897\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q1.<strong>What is the TCS NQT?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans.
