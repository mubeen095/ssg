Data Science is all about finding useful information from big sets of data, using stats and machine learning to make decisions smarter. Both these things are changing and improving industries all around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Data science focuses on getting insights from data, while artificial intelligence (AI) is about creating smart machines that can learn and solve problems on their own. To truly understand their contributions, it&#8217;s important to recognize the differences between Data Science and AI and see how they shape the future of technology and decision-making with information. Both are essential for progress in our understanding and use of technology and data-driven decision-making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-data-science\">What is Data Science?<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"5847\" height=\"3898\" src=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/pexels-rdne-stock-project-7413840-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5746\" style=\"width:502px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data Science is all about finding valuable insights from the data. It involves combining different areas like computer science, statistics, and scientific methods to conclude raw data points. This interdisciplinary approach helps make sense of information that might otherwise be hard to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various Companies such as Airbnb will take advantage of data science to process and analyze their customer-generated data for predicting customer behavior. It will also enable the company to address issues and develop new features, products, and services to provide for the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Additionally, insurance companies and banks can get contact information with data science methods. Data Science has various steps and procedures such as data extraction, manipulation, visualization, and data maintenance. A Data Scientist should know different concepts and technologies such as machine learning algorithms and Al.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-artificial-intelligence\">What is Artificial Intelligence?<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"6000\" height=\"3826\" src=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/pexels-mojahid-mottakin-16107928-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5747\" style=\"width:543px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is like a smart computer program that will try to copy how humans think. When computers have AI, they can learn and get better at solving problems by using lots of information. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al does several things such as understanding human speech, recognizing images, and making decisions. They will teach computers to read and learn from data and will allow them to make smart choices. Artificial Intelligence will figure out things that are hard for people to notice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, AI has become so advanced and is available in our everyday devices such as smartphones and laptops. This makes AI a part of our daily lives, bringing new ways of doing things and making our lives easier. As AI keeps getting better, it&#8217;s changing how we live and work, making everything more efficient and innovative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"difference-of-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence\">Difference Of Data Science And  Artificial Intelligence  <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Aspect<\/td><td><strong>Data Science<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Artificial Intelligence<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Scope and Focus<\/td><td>Data Science <strong>consists of the entire data lifecycle<\/strong>, from collection to analysis<\/td><td> It is <strong>concerned with building intelligent systems<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Techniques Used <\/td><td>Statistical, analytical methods, and machine learning algorithms<br><\/td><td>Neural networks, NLP, expert systems, and more<br><br><\/td><\/tr><tr><td> Goal<\/td><td>It will <strong>Discover patterns and insights from the data<\/strong><br><\/td><td> Artificial Intelligence will<strong>  Develop  systems that are capable of autonomous decision-making<\/strong><br><br><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Applications<\/td><td><strong>Business analytics, healthcare, finance<\/strong>, marketing, and more<\/td><td><strong>Virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles<\/strong>, recommendation systems, etc<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Level of Automation<\/td><td>Data Science has <strong>some automation<\/strong> but often requires human intervention<\/td><td>Whereas, Artificial Intelligence will Aim  at <strong>full automation with minimal human intervention<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Salary<\/td><td> Data Scientists can expect to earn around Rs 7,734,37<\/td><td>AI engineers earn about Rs 8,301,35 per year<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pre-requisite-to-become-a-data-scientist\">Pre-Requisite  To Become a Data Scientist<\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" src=\"https:\/\/www.skillvertex.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/pexels-pixabay-265087.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5749\" style=\"width:553px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong understanding of math, physics, and computer science will allow you to reach a bigger position and get a role in data science.
