It is adapted from journalist Sucheta Dalal and Debashish Basu\u2019s 1992 book The Scam: Who Won, Who Lost, Who Got Away about many stockbrokers including him. This series does not glorify the stock marketer but teaches us about money and success in tangible terms. It also shows us various loopholes in the stock market world that we all need to be aware of before deciding to invest in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013)<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;\">This movie is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort- someone who pled guilty to fraud and crimes in connection with stock market manipulation and running a boiler room as part of a penny stock scam. This dark comedy shows us the loopholes in the financial market and how they can be easily exploited by one.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It also portrays a clear picture of how greed can lead to a disastrous downfall in the stock market. It also shows how a man running behind millions of Dollars can easily break everything that helped him get there.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>THE BIG SHORT (2015)<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are all aware of the financial crisis that took place in the year 2007-2008 in the US, where 7 million people lost their jobs. This movie depicts a dramatic tale of events that takes place during the financial crisis. It is considered to be one of the best stock market movies that not just focuses on debt securities but also teaches us about the trading concepts that all stock marketers should be aware of even in unprecedented times. Three individual but parallel stories are told initially about the US mortgage crisis of 2005. This gives a good perspective on how easily a market that looks really sustainable can crash suddenly.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>WALL STREET (1987)<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the most compelling and popular stock market movies to watch. It revolves around a young and upcoming stockbroker who is willing to do anything to get on top including him tagging along with a ruthless, wealthy corporate raider. It focuses and enlightens us on different concepts related to the stock market that we might relate to in our daily life. The film shows how the market works and that it may crash down at any time. While it&#8217;s been three decades since the movie&#8217;s release, it&#8217;s still used as a tool to teach traders, marketers, bankers, etc., around the globe.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>MARGIN CALL (2011)<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie explores the zestful and fragile world of the stock market and how easily it can be disintegrated. It&#8217;s about an event that takes place in the early stages of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The story revolves around a few crucial people at an investment bank over a 24-hour period and how they handle damage control in the market. The movie takes minimal effort in hiding how carelessly the banks function and explores the actual reason behind the financial crisis in the US. A great analysis of the current financial systems in our system.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>BOILER ROOM (2000)&nbsp;<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie displays the importance of demand &amp; supply chain in the market and how artificial demands can also be created to increase profits. The name boiler room refers to a large-scale operation used to lure in as many investors as possible to an investment scam using high-pressure sales tactics. It gives us a wider perspective of how greed clouds the thought process of investors and how they come up with schemes that would affect the whole system. This movie advises keeping emotions at bay while making effective decisions in the stock market world.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>ROGUE TRADER (1999)&nbsp;<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movie is based on a book by Nick Leeson named A Rogue Trader: How I brought down Barings Bank and Shook the financial world, where he gives a great example of not going against the market. This movie also depicts the psychological functions of a trader who desperately hides his reckless mistakes. A must-watch stock market movie that teaches us about risk management and how financial oversights can be distressing and dreadful.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these stock market movies might deliver a bit of insight into the absurd world of finance, they still fail to teach us some of the vital details required in the market, providing us with a completely different perspective on this profession when it is actually not that complicated. No movie or series has shown us an investor that has made a fortune through disciplined investments in the stock market, and that is something we, at SkillVertex, provide.
