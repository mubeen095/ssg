AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as natural language processing, decision-making, and problem-solving. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, ML is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms to enable machines to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without explicit instructions. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at the differences between AI and ML, how they are related, and how they are transforming various industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the ability of machines or computer programs to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI involves the development of algorithms, models, and systems that can simulate human cognition and behavior, allowing machines to perform complex tasks more efficiently and effectively.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI has various applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and many others, and is transforming the way we live and work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Machine Learning:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ML, or Machine Learning, is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow machines to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, ML involves building computer programs that can automatically improve their performance on a specific task by learning from experience, without being explicitly programmed to do so. ML algorithms are designed to automatically identify patterns in data, learn from those patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ML has many practical applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance, among others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Difference Between AI and ML:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI and ML are two of the most exciting fields in technology today, and are often used interchangeably. However, they are not the same thing. AI refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and natural language processing.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of AI as the parent category, and ML as one of its children. While both are related, they have some fundamental differences. AI focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think and work like humans, whereas ML focuses on teaching machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key difference is their level of autonomy. AI systems can operate independently and make decisions on their own, while ML algorithms require input and guidance from humans to improve their performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, AI and ML are transforming the way we live and work, and their applications are increasingly present in our daily lives. From chatbots to self-driving cars, from voice assistants to personalized recommendations, AI and ML are making our lives easier, more efficient, and more exciting. So buckle up, and let&#8217;s explore these fascinating fields together!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key differences between AI and ML:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) are two related but distinct concepts. AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and natural language processing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ML, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that enable machines to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions without explicit instructions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>SI NO<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>MACHINE
