People who do software testing help find problems and make things better for users. Let&#8217;s check out how much money they make in India this year. This will show us how valued their work is and what opportunities are out there for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"who-is-the-software-tester\">Who is the Software Tester<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Software testing is like giving software a thorough check to make sure it meets what customers want and that it doesn&#8217;t have any problems. It&#8217;s done by running the software using tools, both by hand and automatically, to check different things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, when an app is about to be released, the developer sends it for testing. During testing, the software goes through all sorts of tests with the users in mind. These tests help make sure that when the app is launched, users get a smooth experience without any issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-roles-of-a-software-tester\">What are the Roles of a Software Tester ?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A software tester has a big role when a program is being made for a client. They&#8217;re part of the quality assurance team. The tester gets the program at different stages and tests it in various ways, writing down what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if a developer creates an app for handling customer payments, the code goes to a software tester. The tester does manual and automatic tests on the app. They check things like if the app works well on slow internet and if it updates the account balance right. These tests are called test cases. The app only goes live if it passes all the tests set by the tester.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-software-tester-salary-in-india\">What are the Software Tester Salary in India?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In India, how much a software tester earns is influenced by different things. One important thing is the tester&#8217;s skills. If they&#8217;re really good at software testing and know a lot about it, they can earn a good salary even if they&#8217;re new to the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For testers who want to make more money than the regular pay, having some experience is important. Where they work, like at a top software company, and where they live can also affect how much they earn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-the-average-salary-of-a-software-tester\">What is the Average Salary of a Software Tester?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to PayScale, the average salary for a software tester in India is around \u20b93.5 Lakh per year. But this can be anywhere from \u20b91.80 Lakh to \u20b97.81 Lakh per year, depending on all those things we talked about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to earn more even without a lot of experience, try to get a job offer from a big software company in a place where living costs are high. That can boost your salary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-factors-affecting-software-tester-salary-in-india\">What are the Factors Affecting Software Tester Salary in India?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The four main factors affecting software tester salary are:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Company<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Location<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Experience<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Skills<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"software-tester-salary-by-company\">Software Tester Salary by Company<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The top recruiters for the software tester role are HCL Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services, and Cognizant.
