It&#8217;s popular among people who do data science because it makes it easier for computers to handle spoken or written language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main goal of the NLTPK is to visualize words, tokenize, and make parse trees to make the language more understandable. So, it helps to make applications such as Machine Translation, Speech Recognition, Parts Of Speech Tagging, Text to Speech. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With NLTK, you can do all sorts of language-related tasks, like breaking down words, visualizing them, and even figuring out the structure of sentences. It&#8217;s like having a special set of tools to make computers really good at understanding and using human language. People use NLTK for different things, like translating languages, recognizing speech, and even breaking down words to understand them better. It&#8217;s kind of like a language superhero toolkit for computers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"23-apache-hadoop\">23.

This open-source software is mostly accepted in parallel data processing. It will operate strong and processing of big data which is required for data analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hadoop is a cool tool that helps deal with really big piles of data. Instead of trying to tackle all the data in one go, Hadoop breaks it into smaller chunks and lets different computer teams work on each chunk at the same time. It&#8217;s like having friends help you solve a huge puzzle faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover,  Hadoop can handle all kinds of data, even if it&#8217;s a bit messy. This makes it easier for data scientists and professionals to manage lots of different types of data, no matter how much there is. It&#8217;s like having a helpful assistant for dealing with big data challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"24-qlik-view\">24.
