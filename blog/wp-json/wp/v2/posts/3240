The #ifdef directive checks if a macro is defined. If the macro is defined, the code within the conditional block is included in the preprocessor output. If the macro is not defined, the code within the block is skipped. The #ifndef directive is the opposite of #ifdef. It checks if a macro is not defined. If the macro is not defined, the code within the conditional block is included in the preprocessor output. The #if directive allows you to conditionally include code based on an expression that evaluates to either true or false. If the expression is true, the code is included; otherwise, it&#8217;s skipped.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>ifndef macro_name\n    statement1;\n    statement2;\n    statement3;\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    statementN;\nendif<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas, a macro with the name &#8216;macro name&#8217; has not been defined using the #define directive. Therefore, only the block of statements will be executed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>#if<\/code>: The #if directive allows you to specify a condition, and if that condition evaluates to a non-zero value (true), the code block immediately following #if is executed. If the condition is false (evaluates to zero), the code block is skipped.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>#elif (short for &#8220;else if&#8221;): The #elif directive provides an alternative condition to be checked if the preceding #if or #elif condition is false. If the #elif condition evaluates to a non-zero value, the code block immediately following #elif is executed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>#else<\/code>: The #else directive is used to specify a block of code that is executed when none of the previous conditions (specified in #if or #elif) are met. In other words, if all previous conditions are false, the code block following #else is executed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>#if macro_condition\n   statements\n#elif macro_condition\n   statements\n#else\n   statements\n#endif<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;\n \n#define gfg 7\n  \n#if gfg &gt; 200\n   #undef gfg\n   #define gfg 200\n#elif gfg &lt; 50\n   #undef gfg\n   #define gfg 50\n#else\n   #undef gfg\n   #define gfg 100\n#endif\n \nint main()\n{\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; gfg;  \/\/ gfg = 50\n}    <\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Output<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>50<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>Line control ( #line )<\/strong>: The <code>#line<\/code> directive in C and C++ allows you to control error reporting by specifying the filename and line number associated with error messages. It is useful for custom error reporting and code generation tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>#line number \"filename\"\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>#line<\/code> directive in C and C++ is used to set the line number for the next code line and can also specify an optional filename to be displayed in error messages. The line numbers of successive lines are increased one by one from this point on, and the &#8220;filename&#8221; parameter is used to redefine the file name shown in error messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. <strong>Error directive ( #error )<\/strong>:The <code>#error<\/code> directive is used in C and C++ to intentionally halt the compilation process and generate an error message, which can be optionally specified as a parameter. It is often used for creating custom error messages or for controlling compilation based on specific conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syntax:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>#error optional_error\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Optional_error is an error that is specified by the user and will be displayed when the directive is found in the program.

What are the types of C++ preprocessing directives?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. In C++, preprocessor directives serve various purposes, including defining macros, including files, controlling compilation, handling errors, and more. They are processed before the program&#8217;s actual compilation.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1698996132551\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q2. What is #ifdef and #endif in C++?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. #ifdef is used to check if a symbol is defined. If the specified symbol is defined, the code enclosed between #ifdef and #endif is included in the preprocessor output and compiled.<br \/>#if is used to evaluate a Boolean expression. If the expression following #if evaluates to true, the enclosed code is included in the preprocessor output and compiled.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1698996137438\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h4 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q3.What is a preprocessor directive and its types?<\/h4>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Ans. Preprocessor directives in programming languages, such as C and C++, are lines that start with the <code>#<\/code> character. They are not part of the standard source code but are instructions for the compiler to process certain aspects of the program before actual compilation. Preprocessor directives are used for tasks like macro definitions, conditional compilation, including header files, and other preprocessing tasks to prepare the code for compilation.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>C\/C++ Preprocessor Directives | Set 2 In C and C++, preprocessor directives are lines of code that start with a # symbol and are processed by the preprocessor before the actual compilation of the program.
