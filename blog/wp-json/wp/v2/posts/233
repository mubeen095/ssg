Space complexity is the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the size of the input. They are usually denoted by the Big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that its running time increases linearly with the size of the input.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>10. What is a sorting algorithm? Can you explain bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><i><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Answer<\/span><\/strong><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>:<\/strong> A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements in a specific order. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together. Quicksort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>11. Explain the difference between a stack and a queue data structure.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><i><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Answer<\/span><\/strong><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>:<\/strong> A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, whereas a queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>12.
